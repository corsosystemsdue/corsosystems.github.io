Recently Corso Systems sat down with <a href="http://www.gimbal.com/">Gimbal</a> for some hands on training with their beacon and geo-fencing platform.

<h4>Why beacons and geo-fencing?</h4>

If timing is everything, giving people information at the exact moment they can act on it is the best time.

One take of how to accomplish this is to use location tracking on mobile devices combined with a mapping system to know when people have entered a certain area. This can be walking into a grocery store and sharing coupons, or tracking where operators are in a plant and sharing maintenance or safety information.

What does this look like?

Imagine you have your maintenance crews heading over for their daily equipment checks. Throughout your plant you have defined various areas based on where portions of your process are physically located. Your maintenance management system is aware of these areas, and as your crew enters each of the areas they are sent notifications of any outstanding work orders, or maintenance issues, in real-time.

Contrast this with the time involved for your crew to read over the days requirements in the shop, pack up their tools, go out to do their checks and not come back to the shop until lunch time. That is the first time they are able to catch up with everything going on in the plant.

What about a potentially more serious concern, personnel safety? Instead of waiting for people to come out to a designated meeting spot after a safety drill or real emergency, would you like to watch everyone move from their workstation to where you are, in real-time? If someone was injured or stuck in the building, would you want to know instantly rather than waiting until they haven't shown up outside in a reasonable amount of time?



Needless to say, we were blown away by the functionality their system offers, and how quickly it can be put to use. With literally zero development experience with their platform, it took less than 30 minutes to build a live, fully functional system.
