<h3>Technology is <b style="color:#f64100;">constantly changing</b></h3>

<p>Computers are more powerful than ever. You can access just about anything in the world on your phone, soon even your wrist.</p>

<p>In the manufacturing world computer hardware has overcome the requirements of most software packages. This means when you need to buy a new computer, instead of running it to the max like you would have 3 or 4 years ago, you may only be using <b>10-20%</b> of the hardware's capacity.</p>

<p>Companies like VMWare and Microsoft have developed a way to utilize the unused resources using <b>virtual machines</b>.</p>

<h4>Virtual Machines are computers running on software designed to imitate physical hardware.</h4>

<p>In the same way you can run multiple programs at one time on your PC, with virtual machines, you can run <b>multiple computers</b> on <b>one PC</b> &mdash; at <b>the same time</b>.</p>
<p>Virtual machines used in this way let you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Utilize more of your hardware's resources</li>
	<li>Consolidate multiple physical computers into one</li>
	<li>Swap between computers with no downtime</li>
</ul>

<h3><b style="color:#f64100;">Decrease</b> IT Overhead</h3>

<p>When you need to set up a new machine, you call IT, requisition the hardware, and let them spend a day or two installing all of the software you need.</p>

<p>With a virtual machine you can get a new computer up and running by simply copying a file and opening it.</p>

<h4>Have an old computer you need for only one piece of equipment?</h4>

<p>You can replace it with a virtual machine</p>

<h4>Need multiple versions of your software but they don't play well together?</h4>

<p>You can use virtual machines</p>

<h4>Want to test a new software version without breaking anything?</h4>

<p>Do it with a virtual machine</p>

<h3><b style="color:#f64100;">Leveraging</b> Virtual Machines</h3>

<p>What systems do you need to maintain your process effectively? Maybe you have different PLCs throughout the plant, different HMI systems, or some specialty software for calibrating instruments.</p>

<p>This is the situation we find ourselves in every day. Different customers have different systems and we need to be able to support any of them at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>Staying up to date with the latest releases is critical, and dealing with different versions of software without breaking existing installations can be a nightmare.</p>

<h4>Virtual machines eliminate these problems entirely.</h4>

<p>We have virtual machines ready to go for any software we use. If we want to start working with a new package, we have machines with clean operating systems ready to go.</p>

<p>If a new software release is incompatible with an old version we create a new virtual machine to support it.</p>

<p>Think of us like a maintenance department covering a very wide array of systems. Would you want to make your maintenance department's life easier, with very little cost? Look into virtual machines.</p>
