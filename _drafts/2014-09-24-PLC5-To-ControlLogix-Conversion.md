<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class="left-align">A large potato processing facility in central Idaho replaced Allen Bradley PLC5 processors with ControlLogix and CompactLogix processors and wanted to ensure the new logic conformed to corporate programming standards.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ul class="left-align">
	<li>Facility upgraded to modern hardware</li>
	<li>Logic was updated to current corporate programming standards</li>
	<li>Updating logic to new standards required no unplanned downtime</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul class="left-align">
	<li>Allen Bradley PLC5</li>
	<li>Allen Bradley ControlLogix PLCs</li>
	<li>Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLCs</li>
	<li>Rockwell Automation RSLogix5</li>
	<li>Rockwell Automation RSLogix5000</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p class="left-align">The facility's maintenance staff performed the PLC5 to ControlLogix/CompactLogix conversion and did not have the time to update the logic, addressing, etc. to current corporate programming standards.</p>

<p class="left-align">Our staff reviewed all of the affected logic and created new tags to match current naming conventions. From there we did a line-by-line upgrade of the logic (off-site) to match current standards.</p>

<p class="left-align">During a scheduled downtime for cleaning and other upgrades, we downloaded the new code into the PLCs and spent time on-site verifying the new logic adjacent to the old logic. As the various routines were verfied we updated the I/O mapping to use the new tags and deleted the old tags and logic from the PLC. </p>

<p class="left-align">When we had completed verifying all of the logic the PLC was upgraded to current standards and required no unplanned downtime as part of the process.</p>
