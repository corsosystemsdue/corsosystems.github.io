<p>You are probably aware of the benefits of implementing a Manufacturing Execution System:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce Downtime</li>
	<li>Increase Productivity</li>
	<li>Improve OEE</li>
</ul>

<p>These benefits can come with a decent expense, IT overhead to make sure all of your systems can communicate with one another, and a lot of training.</p> 

<p>What does an MES system give you at its most basic level?</p>

<p><b>Information, formatted to make it easy to prioritize your next steps.</b></p>

<p>Looking through the lens of the Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule as it is commonly referred to, is there a way to get <b>80%</b> of the <b>value</b> of a full-blown MES system with <b>20% of the work</b>?</p>

<p>We <b>absolutely</b> think there is a way, using information you likely already have access to.</p>

<p>Our solution is focused on the following 3 core values:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Simple - <b>information</b> you <b>already have</b> presented in a way you can use with little to <b>no training</b></li>
	<li>Centralized - access from <b>any device</b>, by <b>anyone on your team</b></li>
	<li>Powerful -  your tools should give you <b>leverage</b> making you <b>more effective</b></li>
</ol>
