<p>Twitter and IBM partner up to give businesses a better understanding of their customers.</p>

<h4>Big Data At work</h4>
<br>Just when you thought big data couldn't get any bigger, Twitter and IBM recently announced a new partnership. Here's the breakdown of the deal and what it means for consumers, developers, and businesses.

<p>IBM's super computers like WATSON (which have been known to beat most humans in chess and Jeopardy) will gain access to all twitter data. On the surface you might wonder what exactly IBM is looking to do with all of that data, but Chris Moody, IBM's CEO breaks it down for us.</p>
<p>"This partnership, drawing on IBM's leading cloud-based analytics platform, will help clients enrich business decisions with an entirely new class of data. This is the latest example of how IBM is re-imaging work" -Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President and CEO, IBM.</p>

<p>This is a big deal on both ends of the deal. Twitter houses invaluable data such as how people feel about businesses and who they care about interacting with, while IBM holds the tools that can take that data and turn it into relevant information. Turning data into real world information is arguably more important than having the data itself, and this partnership is going to give businesses a better look at their customers.</p>

<h4>What It Means to Consumers</h4>

<p>Like it or not, everything you post on Twitter, or any form social media, is going to be used to better understand you. A common saying is "if you are not paying for it, you are the product." This phrase is debatable on a case by case basis, but don't fret if you are worried about your personal information. IBM's tools are designed to gain a better understanding of trends in the market and are not focused on the specifics of individual user data. In a lot of cases, these technologies are responsible for giving you access to the best product or services. Ever wonder how a company like Amazon knew exactly what were you were looking for? Data analytics are there to thank when offering your the most relevant information.</p>

<h4>What It Means to Developers</h4>

<p>This new partnership is great news for developers. Especially if you're one of ten thousand plus IBM Global business Services consultants developing business applications with twitter data. Twitter has been extremely transparent and supportive of developers by releasing tools such as Bootstrap, Fabric, and Digits. Twitter always has developers on their radar and does everything it can to help grow the web.</p>

<h4>What It Means to Businesses</h4>

<p>Businesses should be jumping up and down with excitement about this partnership. Understanding your customers is invaluable and will enable you to give them what they want and need. Whether Twitter's data can help you understand how they feel about a product or service, or if you are looking for innovative ideas, IBM's amazing analytics tools have you covered and will help you understand your business on a deeper level.</p>

<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>
<p>Regardless of which category you fall in, everyone has some reason to be excited about two tech giants teaming up to better understand people as a whole. Twitter encapsulates far more than just individual opinions and ideas, hidden underneath the surface is a much clearer look at what everyone cares about and more importantly how they feel. With incredibly smart tools and more data than ever, I am excited to see what comes of this new partnership.</p>
