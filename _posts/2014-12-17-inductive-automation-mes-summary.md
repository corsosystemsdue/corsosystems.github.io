<p>As we discussed in the three previous posts (<a href="/blog/inductive-automation-mes-overview">part 1</a>, <a href="/blog/inductive-automation-mes-details">part 2,</a> and <a href="/blog/inductive-automation-mes-analysis">part 3</a>) Inductive Automation offers a powerful, extremely easy-to-use system.</p>

<p>Like other performance management systems Inductive Automation turns your process' data into information allowing you to increase production and quality, and reduce costs by using existing equipment and labor more effectively.</p>

<p>Going beyond other platforms, Inductive Automation's tools give you the ability to work in the applications you are already familiar with, and provide easy access to you information without licensing hassles. Adding new functionality only requires a new module, not having to learn a new software platform.</p>

<p>Inductive Automation's MES suite takes the burden of tracking down your data and performing the calculations to summarize production losses, downtime, and OEE off of your shoulders, freeing you to tackle the tasks you need to focus on to succeed.</p>
<br/>
<h5><b>Quick to Implement</b></h5>
<p>As part of the Ignition platform, the MES modules are extremely easy to implement. Once they software is installed you can be up and running with useful information in a matter of minutes instead of hours or days.</p>

<p>Leveraging your understanding of your production lines and schedules, implementing cells, your production model, and process events can be a one time procedure giving you full access to everything you need to realize the benefits or can be broken up into phases giving you the ability to scale the system as you become more familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<h5><b>Easy to Maintain</b></h5>
<p>Once the system is up and running you should never have to worry about it again, that is until you want to expand the system to more areas of your process. When that time comes it is as simple as configuring new portions of your production model. All of your data will then be available through your reports and dashboards with no additional effort on your part.</p>

<h5><b>Flexible and Reliable</b></h5>
<p>An Inductive Automation MES system can be as small or as large as you need it to be. As your plant grows your need for information will expand as well. The modules give you the ability to use the same system as the rest of your process to easily collect all of your data and more easily access all of the information using the analysis tools you are already familiar with.</p>

<br/>

<p>Inductive Automation offers a powerful set of tools you can use to improve your operations without having to invest lots of resources in expansion and engineering.
