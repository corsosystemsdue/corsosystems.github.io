summary: "A leading diatomaceous earth processing company worked with us to design and implement a production data management system to track manually entered data"

type: "Case Study"
detail_summary: "<p>A leading diatomaceous earth processing facility was storing some of its production data in Excel spreadsheets.</p><p>After using this method for a while the amount of spreadsheets on their server made it difficult to find specific information in a timely manner.</p><p>The best remedy for this problem was to move to a web-based solution. This approach provided a centralized database to store the data and an interface for authorized users to enter, edit, and view the data.</p>"

focus: "<li>Centralize production data</li><li>Decrease data management overhead</li><li>Optimize business processes</li>"
drive: "<li>Understand existing processes</li><li>Develop web-based system</li><li>Implement system and train personnel on its operation</li><li>Increase value of data by integrating with process data</li>"
results: "<li>Reduced overhead costs</li><li>Increased data utilization</li><li>Increased productivity</li>"
solution: "<p>Our staff worked with a large diatomaceous earth processing facility to implement a web-based system to store and analyze its production data.</p><p>We used the client's existing paper and Excel based tools to develop a database schema for the data.</p><p>With the database in place we developed the web-based front end to enter new data and access existing records. In addition to data entry forms the interface included automated reporting functionality allowing users to select a date-range and/or specific process areas to view production data.</p><p>The system generates nightly reports and sends them to key personnel automatically.</p><p>In addition to tabular views of the data, the system includes pareto charts to track downtime and product loss reasons for a range of dates as well as process OEE.</p><p>The system also includes the ability to automatically gather and store data from the process historian.</p>"
