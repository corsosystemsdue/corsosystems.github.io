solution: "<p>Jaxon Energy's goal was to implement a control system for their new refining facility in Vicksburg MS. The solution had to meet their operational requirements: flexibility to process many different types of raw material, remote and mobile access to the facility from their corporate headquarters, and historical data collection with powerful data analysis tools, all while being fully integrated with their corporate business systems.</p>
<p>Jaxon Energy and Cam 2 International teamed up with Corso Systems to implement a process control and information system for its Vicksburg, MS refinery. Jaxon leveraged Siemens WinCC Open Architecture platform plant operation and secure remote and mobile device access the facility.</p>

<p>The foundation of the plant's control system is a Siemens S7-1200 PLC utilizing completely templatized equipment logic. WinCC OA, with templatized graphic and scripting objects works seamlessly with the S7-1200 to operate the plant. This architecture reduced overall development time compared to similar systems by over 40%. The WinCC OA Ultralight client was deployed to enable  remote access from to the plant from Jaxon's Reno NV headquarters and mobile devices. WinCC OA's built-in historian tools historize process data and the built-in trending tools display a comprehensive and contextualized picture of process conditions. For shipping and receiving product reconciliation, Corso Systems developed a custom solution utilizing Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC platform. This system was designed to allow operators to track incoming raw material and outgoing finished product shipments, including quality information. Combined with the control system, this provides an end-to-end account of the location and quality of every drop of material in the facility at any given time.</p>"
