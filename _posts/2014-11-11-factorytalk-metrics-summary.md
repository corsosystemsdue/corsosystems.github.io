<p>As we discussed in the three previous posts (<a href="/blog/factorytalk-metrics-overview.html">part 1</a>, <a href="/blog/factorytalk-metrics-backend.html">part 2,</a> and <a href="/blog/factorytalk-metrics-data-analysis.html">part 3</a>) FactoryTalk Metrics is a powerful, easy-to-use performance management system.</p>

<p>Like other performance management systems FactoryTalk Metrics turns your process' data into information allowing you to increase production and quality, and reduce costs by using existing equipment and labor more effectively.</p>

<p>FactoryTalk Metrics takes the burden of tracking down your data and performing the calculations to summarize production losses, downtime, and OEE off of your shoulders, freeing you to tackle the tasks you need to focus on to succeed.</p>
<br/>
<h5><b>Quick to Implement</b></h5>
<p>As part of the FactoryTalk family of products, Metrics is extremely easy to implement. Once the software is installed and you can communicate with your PLCs using the FactoryTalk administration console getting your data into the system is a quick process.</p>

<p>Leveraging your understanding of your production lines and schedules, implementing work cells, equipment models, and events can be a one time procedure giving you full access to everything you need to realize the benefits or can be broken up into phases giving you the ability to scale the system as you become more familiar with its capabilities.</p>

<h5><b>Easy to Maintain</b></h5>
<p>Once the system is up and running you should never have to look at the backend again, that is until you want to expand the system to more areas of your process. When that time comes it is as simple as configuring new work cells and equipment. All of your data will then be available through your reports with no additional effort on your part.</p>

<h5><b>Flexible and Reliable</b></h5>
<p>A FactoryTalk Metrics system can be as small or as large as you need it to be. As your plant grows your need for information will expand as well. Metrics gives you the ability to use the same system to easily collect all of your data and more easily access all of the information using the reports you are already familiar with.</p>

<br/>

<p>FactoryTalk Metrics is a powerful tool you can use to improve your operations without having to invest lots of resources in expansion and engineering.
