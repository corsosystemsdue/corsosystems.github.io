summary: "Designed and implemented a standardized SCADA system for a solar power generation company put into use at multiple facilities generating 109MW of total power."

detail_summary: "<p>Our staff met with the SCADA operations team for a large solar power provider to discuss a standardized system built using Wonderware System Platform. The goal was to build objects for the various pieces of equipment at a solar plant, inverters, breakers, power meters, etc., to enable rapid deployment of SCADA systems for new facilities.</p>
		<p>As part of developing the system we developed a standardized naming convention for the facilities and all of the datapoints to allow a script to populate a centralized OSI PI Historian with data from each facility.</p>
		<p>After completion of the initial development future systems took less time as the SCADA system was built using existing objects and commissioning was basically complete after I/O and communication verifications.</p>
		<p>With remote access to each facility we also reduced support time and costs by allowing our staff to login to each system to make any neccessary modifications, including updating older facilities with any objects developed for newer facilities.</p>"

focus: "<li>Reduce future development costs</li><li>Standardized systems</li><li>Automated data analysis</li>"
drive: "<li>Develop system using cutting-edge hardware and software</li><li>Implement system and train personnel on its operation</li><li>Reduce overhead costs for data analysis</li>"
results: "<li>Decreased commissioning time</li><li>Remote access to all facilities</li><li>Increased data visibility</li>"
solution: "<p>We were tasked to develop a standardized SCADA Solution for a leading solar power provider. They had advanced data reporting and analytics requirements, a need for remote monitoring and management of their facilities, and wanted to reduce commission times on new facilities due to a period of rapid growth.</p><p>We worked with their data management team to define naming conventions and develop a standard set of data points to be used across various types of solar generation equipment. This included interfaces to power meters in different countries with different utility reporting requirements.</p><p>After developing the SCADA system and implementing it at each of the facilities the plant operators were able to use a familiar interface at each facility to monitor and control power generation remotely.</p><p>Data from each facility was automatically sent to their corporate level OSI PI Historian along with reports for daily generation, system alarms and upsets, as well as operator logs for each facility.</p>"
