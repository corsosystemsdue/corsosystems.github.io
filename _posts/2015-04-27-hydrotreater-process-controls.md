solution: "<p>Jaxon Energy's goal was to implement a control system for their new hydrotreating facility in Jackson MS. The solution had to meet their operational requirements: flexibility to process many different types of raw material, remote access to the facility from their corporate headquarters, and historical data collection with powerful data analysis tools, all while being fully integrated with their corporate business systems.</p>
<p>Jaxon Energy teamed up with Corso Systems to develop a new control and information system for its Jackson, MS hydrotreating plant. Jaxon leveraged Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk software suite for robust operator control of the plant and secure remote access to real-time information.</p>

<p>The foundation of the plant's control system is an Allen Bradley ControlLogix PLC utilizing PlantPAX add-on instructions, a process gas treatment system controlled by an Allen Bradley CompactLogix PLC, and a waste disposal system controlled by an Allen Bradley MicroLogix PLC. FactoryTalk View SE using PlantPAX graphics gives operators an interface to monitor and control the plant, with FactoryTalk ViewPoint providing remote access from to the plant from Jaxon's Reno NV headquarters. FactoryTalk Historian combined with FactoryTalk VantagePoint gathers control-system data from the process, and displays a comprehensive and contextualized picture of process conditions. Corso Systems developed a custom solution utilizing Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC platform. This system was designed to allow operators to track incoming raw material and outgoing finished product shipments, including quality information. Combined with the control system, this provides an end-to-end account of the location and quality of every drop of material in the facility at any given time.</p>"
