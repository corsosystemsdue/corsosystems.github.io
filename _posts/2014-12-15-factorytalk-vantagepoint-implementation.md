summary: "Implemented FactoryTalk VantagePoint and FactoryTalk Historian to store and analyze process data at multiple facilities for a leading diatomaceous earth processing company."

detail_summary: "<p>A large diatomaceous earth process company wanted to historize process data from one of its older facilities and view the data using modern trending and reporting tools.</p><p>After using the system, maintenance staff uncovered the cause of a common maintenance issue, reducing future troubleshooting time by an average of 85%.</p>"
industry: "Mining"
location: "Northern NV"

focus: "<li>Collect and analyze process data</li><li>Standardized systems</li><li>Automated data analysis</li>"
drive: "<li>Develop system using cutting-edge software</li><li>Implement system and train personnel on its operation</li><li>Reduce overhead costs for data analysis</li>"
results: "<li>Decreased troubleshooting time</li><li>Historized data</li><li>Increased data visibility</li>"
solution: "<p>The client had previous experience with FactoryTalk Historian at another facility. After upgrading one of their older facilities with a new power generation system they wanted to be able to track generation data as well as process data at this facility.</p><p>We worked with their process engineer to identify which datapoints they wanted to store as well as to develop the VantagePoint model for making the data easily accessible to operators and maintenance staff.</p><p>Once we had determined the relevant data we implemented the system and provided training for the facility's staff.</p><p>After becoming familiar with the system one of the maintenance crew members began looking into issues with some of their equipment and found a correlation between pressure readings and motor failures in different areas of the process. This information reduced the amount of time to find and troubleshoot these issues from almost a day to less than an hour, a decrease of more than 85% on average.</p>"
