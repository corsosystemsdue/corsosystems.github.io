<p>As we discussed in the three previous posts (<a href="/blog/simatic-performance-management-overview.html">part 1</a>, <a href="/blog/wincc-performance-monitor.html">part 2,</a> and <a href="/blog/simatic-information-server.html">part 3</a>) Siemens Performance Monitor combined with Simatic Information Server provides a powerful, easy-to-use performance management system.</p>

<p>Like other performance management systems Siemens' Performance Management tools turn your process' data into information allowing you to increase production and quality, and reduce costs by using existing equipment and labor more effectively.</p>

<p>WinCC Performance Manager takes the burden of tracking down your data and performing the calculations to summarize KPIs, downtime, and OEE off of your shoulders, freeing you to tackle the tasks you need to focus on to succeed.</p>
<br/>
<h5><b>Quick to Implement</b></h5>
<p>As part of the WinCC suite of products Performance Manager and Information server are easy to install, quick to configure, and give you the information you need with very little effort.</p>

<p>Leveraging your understanding of your production lines and schedules, your process models and KPI calculations and events can be a one time procedure giving you full access to everything you need to realize the benefits or can be broken up into phases giving you the ability to scale the system as you become more familiar with its capabilities.</p>
<br/>
<h5><b>Easy to Maintain</b></h5>
<p>Once the system is up and running you should never have to look at the backend again, that is until you want to expand the system to more areas of your process. When that time comes it is as simple as configuring new KPIs and calculations. All of your data will then be available through your reports with no additional effort on your part.</p>
<br/>
<h5><b>Flexible and Reliable</b></h5>
<p>A Performance Monitor system can be as small or as large as you need it to be. As your plant grows your need for information will expand as well. Siemens' tools gives you the ability to use the same system to easily collect all of your data and more easily access all of the information using the reports you are already familiar with.</p>

<br/>

<p>WinCC Performance Monitor combined with Simatic Information Server is a powerful solution you can use to improve your operations without having to invest lots of resources in expansion and engineering.
