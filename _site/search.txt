Imagine you run a small brewery. You take raw ingredients, run them through the mashing and boiling processes, let the liquid ferment and finally put it into bottles or cans to be shipped to your customers. Odds are your goal is to produce an amazing and consistent product. Why leave quality up to chance? With your recipes as a foundation, you likely use a clipboard to track data for each batch. The amount of raw ingredients, what variety of hops, how long you boiled everything, fermentation duration, alcohol content, etc. Once you have run a complete batch through quality control you might generate some more data on color, taste, clarity, and so on. What do you do with this data once you are done? Instead of a drawer as the final home for your data, imagine you open a web-browser, log in to a site and input the data into a database. For each step of the brewing process you can pull up a report comparing this batch to any or all of your previous batches and get a detailed view of how it compares. You can even have a good idea of what your final product will look like based on all of your experience with the data to back up your instincts. Turning Data Into Information The real value of the data comes when you make subsequent batches and generate more data. If you make a particularly great tasting batch, can you easily identify what was different about the process compared to a normal batch? Were there any differences in your ingredients? Would you like to be able to repeat your results and have the ability to spot trends in your final products? When a major distributor picks up your product and you need to increase production how easily can you ramp up production to meet demand? Answering these questions is easy when you have context combined with data. Information. These questions are all things a large brewer like Anheuser-Busch has answered. AB might be a bad word within your walls . We are not suggesting you become them, only bringing to light the fact they have consistency and quality control figured out. They track a lot of data for every batch. If something ends up tasting off in the end product they can compare the batch to every other batch in their database and diagnose likely causes. They track the effect of various ingredients on the final product, finding ways to brew consistent tasting products at any of their facilities. Granted their brewing process is heavily automated simplifying data collection, still the concepts of using a centralized data collection system to brew smarter can be implemented in any size brewery. We implement similar systems in other industries making the lives of operators and artisans easier. Once people get their hands on this type of technology they get excited about what they can do next. Turning data into information makes it easy to increase productivity , consistency , and customer satisfaction . Intelligent information about a process truly expands the horizon of what is possible and gives people the tools to operate at their highest potential.

You are probably familiar with the responsibility of managing a project — obstacles that come with keeping on schedule — staying under budget — keeping the team focused. On any project there are a lot of moving pieces. Whether you're building a deck or managing an expansion to a new facility there are common issues you will face. Dates get pushed back, material prices change, sub-contractors don't show up, and before you know it the schedule and budget are as good as gone. Take a construction company. A project manager has many responsibilities, including, but not limited to:</> Managing employees day to day tasks, Coordinating sub-contractors' visits Maintaining customer relationships Checking email and messages to stay up to date with the main office This amount of information can be overwhelming for one person to keep track of and often gets lost in translation. When the scope of work or the time of a meeting changes, material delivery is late, or the customer updates a request, not everyone on the team will be automatically updated, if at all. This makes it difficult to track what's getting done. That leads to the main office getting bits and pieces of information and a team in the field trying to finish a project on a faulty foundation. Through our experience working with projects both large and small we've seen anything and everything that can go wrong. That's what led us to building project management software to solve the headaches of staying on schedule, under budget, and in communication with your team. Project Management software is a framework for your every day processes that can be used as frequently or as little as necessary. Depending on how much communication you want, every major or minor change that happens can be pushed to anyone who needs to know automatically. We have seen countless situations where teams work better and communicate more efficiently by letting software do the heavy lifting for them. Take the construction company as an example. With a project management system in place, the foreman can handle changes in the field and update everyone on the project as things occur. The system can alert people in the way that best suits them, whether it be text message, email, or otherwise. Project management software is found in every industry and can be applied to any project. Every industry uses these systems in their own unique way.Our tools are flexible enough to support them all. The best way to implement a project management system at your company is to use it on a small project to get your feet wet. Chances are you and your team will find things you love and other things that need to be tailored to your specific needs. If you decide these systems are beneficial to your team and process, it's important to find a tool that can grow with your company.

Production scheduling, process data from the plant floor, shipping and receiving management, staff scheduling, etc. Most of the time these systems are implemented at different points of a company's lifecycle and are not designed with the other systems in mind. With today's technology making it easy to integrate systems into a cohesive tool, see how you can get more value from your existing infrastructure. A Mile in Your Shoes When we go to a facility for the first time we put ourselves in your shoes as we seek to understand your culture, people, and processes. We tend to find a few common, interesting things: Work orders are usually on a sheet of paper physically located at operator workstations Inefficient communication throughout the entire process - from customer orders to the production floor all the way through order fulfillment Machine maintenance being done too often or not often enough, causing too much planned or unplanned downtime Delays in the process not being communicated back to production scheduling causing an increase in lead times Quality control staff asking production staff for process data information costing time on both sides of the equation Many of these issues cause delays in order fulfillment and ultimately increase workload and stress on your staff. This not only can lead to mandatory overtime to meet production demand while still maintaining the delivery schedule, but also to not meeting customer expectations and possibly hurting relationships. Enter the concept of the digital factory. By utilizing fully-integrated systems and mobile technology, production efficiency and employee effectiveness can operate at their highest potential. Let's take a look at a few ideas of how intelligent systems can streamline your operation: Communication Across the Organization Notification: Communication can happen automatically, alerting staff on a periodic or real-time basis about changes in production, maintenance issues, process metrics and KPIs Documentation: Information on how to handle process upsets, workflow manuals or any other required documentation can be built directly into your systems no longer requiring operators to leave their station to ask a question Information: Process data can be made available from the shop to the top floor including QA/QC, shipping, sales, and management keeping everyone up-to-date at a level of granularity specific to their needs Organization: If you have more than one facility everyone in your entire company can keep up to date with all of your production facilities. You can also limit access to any portion of the system to specific employees, giving everyone access to the information they need to see, when they need to see it Training and Best Practices Tutorials: Training materials can be easily accessible when they are immediately useful making it easy for operators to accomplish periodic tasks in a timely manner and make it easy to cross train other employees on any job function Internal Wiki: Best practices, detailed instructions and institutional knowledge can all be recorded making it easy to keep everyone up to speed on how things should be done at your company Worker Productivity Maintenance: Your work order system can be directly integrated into plant floor data to automatically generate work orders as they are needed per manufacturer's specifications reducing under or over-maintaining equipment. Maintenance personnel can update and manage work orders with automatic notification to operators and other personnel as maintenance work is completed Operations: Your operations staff can quickly see when process upsets will affect their workflow, as well as generate and monitor maintenance work-orders directly from their stations Metrics: In-app dashboards can show metrics for your facility keeping them front-of-mind for your staff. These metrics can include the KPIs you already use to track the health of your operation with the added benefit of brining up historical data to compare to previous production shifts at any time These are just a handful of the potentially unlimited number of ideas on how you can utilize a fully integrated, intelligent system at your organization. When you empower your people to do their job more effectively you will see improvement in the KPIs and metrics you use to monitor the health of your operation. This can result in happier customers, employees and improve your bottom line by better utilizing the data you already have available.

Keeping everyone up to date on every aspect of operations can take a lot of time and lead to lots of confusion. Find out what many companies have found to be a better way to track performance. Keeping It Simple Do you ever procrastinate when you need to put together a report on how your company is doing on any given day? You may have to dig through a handful of reports, run some calculations in Excel and go interrupt some other people to get information on their department. What if all of this work could be boiled down into an automatically generated report emailed out to everyone who needs the information? What if the report gave anyone who wanted to dig deeper the ability to get the information at the level of detail they want, on-demand? This type of system is one of the benefits of the idea of the digital factory. As each department completes its tasks relevant information is entered into the intelligence database. You and your staff determine the important metrics to measure and calculations you use to distill those metrics into a handful of numbers known as Key Performance Indicators or KPIs. The Rubber Meets The Road What is a KPI? A KPI is a way to simply convey complex information. One example in the manufacturing world is known as Overall Equipment Effectiveness or OEE. This is a calculation involving the uptime of a process, the quality of produced goods, and how quickly those goods were produced. These values are compared to their ideal amounts giving you a percentage value of the health of your operation. Once you have this value you can determine if it meets your needs or if it needs to be improved. If it needs to be improved you drill down into the three component values and start asking questions. Is one of the metrics causing the number to drop quite a bit? Which one? If your line is accruing lots of unplanned downtime dig deeper and see how to fix it. If you are getting a larger than usual number of bad parts, why? This functionality can be built directly into your system, automatically generating OEE per day, shift, etc. The values in the report can be directly linked to raw data allowing you to ask and answer any questions you may have about the data in the report. Looking Forward We will dig deeper into how you can implement KPIs at your company in the next few posts. For now here is a list of a few common KPIs we have helped out customers design systems around: OEE - based on runtime, quality, process speed Average Production Per Shift - comparing shifts can lead to friendly competition Downtime - reducing downtime increases productivity Changeover Time - reducing changeover time increases process runtime Equipment/Process Alarms - tracking the number of alarms for various pieces of equipment can be an indicator of potential maintenance needs Reject Count - tracking reject counts per line or piece of equipment can give you indications of potential workflow or process changes you may want to implement We are always looking for ways to help our customers and others in any industry.

Learn how you can start small and avoid common pitfalls companies run into when rolling out a comprehensive system all at once. One mistake organizations make when rolling out performance monitoring is to try and capture all of the data at one time. Instead of building a cultural foundation it is taken on as a project with a lot riding on its success. This is an easy approach to start out with based on the marketing material and training for performance monitoring methodologies. After consuming a handful of brochures, books and webinars it might seem that performance monitoring is a silver bullet to solve all of your companies needs. While it is a great tool, performance monitoring is just that and by not learning how to use it properly on the small scale it can fail to live up to its expectations at scale. If you were new to construction would you get more return in the long run by building a mansion as your first project or building up to that after starting with a playhouse? Starting small with a pilot test of performance monitoring at your company has some distinct advantages: 1. Wax on, Wax off Just like most other things you have learned in life reading about it doesn't alone make you a master. Instead you learn more by starting with a small goal, figuring out how to achieve it and growing from there. 2. ...And that's the bottom line By starting small you can prove the capability of performance monitor to provide an ROI. You can also learn how to build the tools into the culture and avoid wasting valuable resources by over-developing your tools up-front. 3. Engagement should come naturally With a comprehensive approach to performance monitoring you will inevitably get pushback from some people who feel like they are being forced into a new paradigm. By starting small you can work with the people most likely to embrace the change and allow them to become your internal champions. Getting buy-in prior to rolling out performance monitoring is a much better way to ensure its success. Looking Ahead The next question you might have is where you should look to start with your performance monitoring efforts. Depending on your company you may have a lot of options, we will look at some common ones and some case studies in future posts. We are always looking for ways to help our customers and others in any industry.

By learning and documenting your processes you can easily identify key results to use in your performance monitoring efforts. What is one of the first things Warren Buffett, one of the world's most successful investors, does when he buys a company? If most of his purchases are anything like some companies he recently purchased at which we know a lot of people, it is to understand and document their existing processes. The goal behind this is two-fold. First it is to understand what the company has done to make it successful enough for him to want to purchase in the first place. The second is to see where the company's processes need to be streamlined or replaced with his own processes. There is another benefit to this method as opposed to going into a company and revamping their entire workflow from the beginning. It makes it easier to get everyone's buy-in on the restructuring. Defense For people who are passionate about what they do, restructuring can be hard to swallow. They may have some personal investment in the processes themselves, having developed or influenced them along the way. Ripping out those processes and putting in new ones can immediately put someone in their position on the defensive. This isn't a bad thing or a character flaw, it is a normal reaction to hearing your way of doing things might not be the best way out there. Instead if the processes are documented and understood they can be assessed on a level playing field with a different way of doing things. This can lead to fruitful discussions with the stakeholder in the original process feeling like they are being heard and can dramatically increase their level of buy-in. First and 10 Once discussions about the old and the new methodologies have taken place incremental changes can be made. This is not unlike American football in that the goal every play isn't to score a touchdown, it is to move the ball 10 yards down the field to maintain possession on the path to scoring a touchdown. This approach breaks down the final result into small, easily digestible, and complete-able chunks. It also makes it easy to track progress and understand what is working and what needs to be adjusted along the way. Two-Point Conversion In addition to obtaining buy-in, the other benefit to the incremental approach to change is the ability for there to be learning in both directions. Every so often there will be an idea Warren Buffett might adopt from one of his subsidiaries that can change how his other companies are run. To keep to the football analogy this is like the introduction of the two-point conversion to make the game a little more interesting to watch. This isn't necessarily going to be a complete overhaul of the system, just a subtle tweak to make it better overall. Post-Game Wrap-up The first step in implementing a performance monitoring strategy isn't to dive in and build a system with a dashboard and some metrics. The first step is to understand how your business operates and the processes used to run it day to day. Once you know those you can easily identify what you can and should measure to begin improving things. Someday you might make it to the Superbowl but first you need to be able to make it 10 yards down the field. We are always looking for ways to help our customers and others in any industry.

Big Data At work Just when you thought big data couldn’t get any bigger, Twitter and IBM recently announced a new partnership. Here’s the breakdown of the deal and what it means for consumers, developers, and businesses. IBM's super computers like WATSON (which have been known to beat most humans in chess and Jeopardy) will gain access to all twitter data. On the surface you might wonder what exactly IBM is looking to do with all of that data, but Chris Moody, IBM's CEO breaks it down for us. \"This partnership, drawing on IBM's leading cloud-based analytics platform, will help clients enrich business decisions with an entirely new class of data. This is the latest example of how IBM is re-imaging work\" -Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President and CEO, IBM. This is a big deal on both ends of the deal. Twitter houses invaluable data such as how people feel about businesses and who they care about interacting with, while IBM holds the tools that can take that data and turn it into relevant information. Turning data into real world information is arguably more important than having the data itself, and this partnership is going to give businesses a better look at their customers. What It Means to Consumers Like it or not, everything you post on Twitter, or any form social media, is going to be used to better understand you. A common saying is \"if you are not paying for it, you are the product.\" This phrase is debatable on a case by case basis, but don't fret if you are worried about your personal information. IBM's tools are designed to gain a better understanding of trends in the market and are not focused on the specifics of individual user data. In a lot of cases, these technologies are responsible for giving you access to the best product or services. Ever wonder how a company like Amazon knew exactly what were you were looking for? Data analytics are there to thank when offering your the most relevant information. What It Means to Developers This new partnership is great news for developers. Especially if you're one of ten thousand plus IBM Global business Services consultants developing business applications with twitter data. Twitter has been extremely transparent and supportive of developers by releasing tools such as Bootstrap, Fabric, and Digits. Twitter always has developers on their radar and does everything it can to help grow the web. What It Means to Businesses Businesses should be jumping up and down with excitement about this partnership. Understanding your customers is invaluable and will enable you to give them what they want and need. Whether Twitter's data can help you understand how they feel about a product or service, or if you are looking for innovative ideas, IBM's amazing analytics tools have you covered and will help you understand your business on a deeper level. Wrapping Up Regardless of which category you fall in, everyone has some reason to be excited about two tech giants teaming up to better understand people as a whole. Twitter encapsulates far more than just individual opinions and ideas, hidden underneath the surface is a much clearer look at what everyone cares about and more importantly how they feel. With incredibly smart tools and more data than ever, I am excited to see what comes of this new partnership.

One way of doing this is by using Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk Metrics package. In this series we will cover the basics of what Metrics does and its benefits, details on implementation , and how to quickly realize the ROI on your investment. Turning Data into Information Many manufacturing companies cannot easily assess the health of their plants. This is rarely due to a lack of data. Process Historians collect real-time data and can be used to show trends over time, quality control data can be compared to those trends and even some KPIs can be calculated for the process as a whole. This system breaks down when raw data is the only resource available to provide the necessary insight to answer questions about operations. Data fails to take into account micro-level details affecting macro-level performance. For example, with raw data alone it can be difficult to determine which machines are causing the most downtime, where bottlenecks are in the process and where quality losses are greatest. Determining the top 10 causes of downtime would require first collecting all of the data in one location, summing the downtime for all pieces of equipment, and ordering the list. If you are lucky you might be able to get all of this done before the phone rings with some other distractions. How do people find ways to track their process, find the major issues, and get them resolved? One way is to use performance management systems such as FactoryTalk Metrics. These type of systems take the process data you are already collecting and provide the context necessary for the data to be useful as a decision making tool. Deciding to Do Things Differently The decision to implement a performance monitoring system can seem daunting. The cost of buying the software, the time involved in configuring things, learning a new system and integrating it into your workflow. While there are some costs associated with the system both in terms of time and resources, these systems can have a direct impact on your bottom line. One simple is example of this is by using the tools to identify and reduce the top 3 reasons for downtime in your plant, thus automatically increasing productivity. Our customers have made similar gains by decreasing processing time by identifying bottlenecks and reducing re-work and scrap by identifying faulty equipment. In this series we will focus on FactoryTalk Metrics. We will answer some common questions about what FactoryTalk Metrics is, what it isn't, and discuss of the direct benefits our customers have found after using the tools. If you are looking at similar solutions from other companies, we will cover those after we discuss FactoryTalk Metrics. We have worked with similar tools from most of the major companies and will do a compare and contrast post after we have gone into some detail across the board. To summarize, performance management systems give you the ability to ask questions about your operation while at the same time giving you the information you need to answer those questions and prioritize improvements. The give you an honest assessment of your plant's health. While this may be difficult to stomach, if your plant needs some help wouldn't you want to know exactly what to fix to make it better?

A way to get data into the system, a way to analyze that data and a way to view the results. FactoryTalk Metrics operates the same way. Data from your process control system is brought into Metrics using FactoryTalk Transaction Manager, stored in a SQL Server database and accessed in reports using Report Expert or along with real-time process data visualization using FactoryTalk VantagePoint. In this post we will give you an overview of how FactoryTalk Metrics models your process and data is brought into the system. The next post will discuss how to access the data using Report Expert and FactoryTalk VantagePoint in addition to integrating with other business systems you may be using. Modeling Your Process FactoryTalk Metrics allows you to logically model your entire process. This is done is by defining areas known as \"work cells\". In a typical configuration a work cell would be mapped to a specific area of the process, for example, packaging or raw material feed. For each work cell you can track OEE and its components, downtime, throughput, and production cycle times in addition to various events from your process. Work cells are comprised of various pieces of equipment. In a packaging work cell at a food and beverage facility you may have a former, a filler, a sealer, and a metal detector. You can track downtime, throughput, cycle time, and events for each piece of equipment in your work cell. FactoryTalk Metrics also allows you to enter your production schedules, shifts and planned downtime. Utilizing your actual production schedules allows you to analyze data by shift, crew, and by date giving you the ability to further understand how your entire plant, including personnel, is doing. By utilizing work cells and production scheduling to model your facility you can use FactoryTalk Metrics to get a detailed view of every piece of equipment in your entire facility during all of your scheduled production runs. You also have the ability to monitor how each piece of equipment contributes to your process losses. This removes operator error in tracking process upsets and gives you a true view of the health of your plant. Tracking Your Process Work cells and equipment utilize events to trigger downtime start/end times, track throughput and changes in cycle times. This allows you to configure complex conditions for tracking downtime including when upstream or downstream issues cause production losses at any point in the process. Each event can utilize manually entered information, including reason codes. The true power of events comes into play when you implement automatic reason code tracking. This feature allows you to easily determine when your process went down, what piece(s) of equipment took it down, and the exact reason for the problem. This allows you to understand, on great detail, the cause of your most common production losses, allowing you to quickly and clearly prioritize maintenance and process changes to affect your bottom line. All of the data tracked by FactoryTalk Metrics is accessible using the included analysis tools and can be integrated into other business systems directly through the database. This gives you the ability to truly turn your process data into useful information from the shop floor to the top floor. Communicating With Your Process The central nervous system of FactoryTalk Metrics is FactoryTalk Transaction Manager. The data from your PLCs can be stored directly into a SQL Server database using FactoryTalk Transaction Manager. This allows you to populate the FactoryTalk Metrics database, and also to get real-time process data directly into any of your other SQL Server based systems without having to go through a Process Historian. Granted you don't want to store all of your process data this way, still it is extremely useful to save some manual data entry into you ERP system for example. A Full-Service Performance Management Solution Implementing FactoryTalk Metrics gives you accurate, real-time tracking of your processes' performance and the tools you need to analyze and improve operations. In addition to tracking OEE and its components, downtime, throughput, and cycle time, you can incorporate data from your PLCs directly into any of your other SQL Server based systems using FactoryTalk Transaction Manager. FactoryTalk Metrics is an easy to configure and use tool capable of giving you the ability to understand and manage your process at an extremely detailed level.

Report Expert provides a quick and simple way to access the most common data used to assess plant performance with pre-configured reports capable of tracking your entire process or filtering down to any level of detail to answer your most important questions. Reports One of the main benefits of FactoryTalk Metrics is how quickly you can view actionable data from the system. Using the Report Expert package, in a matter of minutes you can have access to 69 pre-configured reports filterable by just about any metric you can imagine. These reports allow you to drill down to the finest level of detail on any piece of equipment to understand the exact causes for production losses at any point in time. In addition to the out-of-the-box reports you have full access to modify the existing reports or create your own from scratch. Custom reports can also be used to display information from other systems you may be using, giving you even greater access to information across your entire organization. These reports can also easily be auto-generated and sent out to key-personnel in your organization. No longer will you need to spend hours going through process logs, tracking incomplete records on downtime, and trying to understand notes from an operator on hour 7 of a graveyard shift to put together an Excel spreadsheet to calculate overall losses. You can instead show up at the beginning of your shift with a clear view of exactly what your process did the previous day. Sorting all of your events by reason codes will give you the insight into what needs to be fixed and the exact impact those efforts will have on production. With this information in hand you can easily go from putting out fires to focus on continuous improvement. Trending In addition to reports you can display all of the data from your FactoryTalk Metrics system in FactoryTalk VantagePoint with less time to configure than it takes to make your morning coffee. If you have a process historian you can put process and Metrics data on one trend allowing you to understand exactly what your process was doing prior to any events. The power in this scenario lies in the ability to begin to notice issues long before they happen. One real-world example from one of our customers is at a powder processing facility. They noticed the pumps used to move powder from drying to processing were shutting down on a regular basis causing large amounts of downtime. The issue was as the powder was pushed through the pipes sometimes it would start to clog and if left unchecked for the rest of the shift would cause blockages and the pumps to trip on over-current. After understanding the cause of the issue and tracking when the equipment went down alongside real-time data, the engineer noticed that between 2 and 3 hours prior to the fan tripping off the amperage had a slight spike with a correlating pressure drop at the pipe exit shortly thereafter. This information was implemented as an event with automatic notification for maintenance to clear the blockage at the next break. This nearly eliminated this issue as a cause for downtime immediately increasing the plant's average production. Business System Integration If you have any systems elsewhere in your business you can easily integrate FactoryTalk Metrics information into their workflows. Maybe process downtime directly affects product quality testing schedules. You can notify your quality technicians of process upsets on particular product runs allowing them to schedule their time more effectively. Another example might be when product quality directly affects when shipments will go out and the shipping department can be immediately notified of delays so they can manage customer expectations as soon as necessary to maintain customer agreements. Integrating with your business systems is likely more complicated than implementing FactoryTalk Metrics in the first place, however you can work with your IT staff or outside developers to access this data directly from the database. We have leveraged this capability for many of our customers with great success. All of the data is available for you to use and there is excellent documentation on how everything is laid out making it easy to access the information to provide value to your entire organization. T-Minus Time to Success Implementing the reporting and analysis tools for FactoryTalk Metrics is a very quick process. Using the pre-built reports in Report Expert gives you access to the most common pieces of information used to impact your bottom line. If something is not immediately available in the stock reports you can easily build your own custom reports. Possibly the most important question you can answer is why wouldn't you want to have access to all of the information about your process? If you could increase capacity, reduce costs, and enable continuous improvement using the equipment you already have along with better information would that better your bottom line?

Where would you even begin to calculate this value if someone asked for it? We are going to show you how you can incorporate all of the costs associated with producing products into an overall cost-per-unit. This value can be calculated in real-time, giving you a concrete demonstration of how your day-to-day actions directly affect your bottom line. Energy One potentially variable cost to manufacturing is energy. This mainly includes electricity and gas, and could also include the cost of heating your plant, leaving the lights on, etc. If you are IKEA you can save the cost of the lights by using robots to do all of the work. Depending on your facility you may be able to install power meters that track the global energy usage of your plant, or you might be able to install equipment level monitoring. Either way or a combination of both will give you better information about the cost-per-unit. From these meters you can read data directly into your process historian. If your plant is in a place where the temperature doesn't fluctuate much during the year you might find your climate control costs to be pretty constant. If this is the case, this along with other fixed costs, you have the option of building these directly into your calculation of cost-per-unit. If instead you live in an area where the temperature fluctuates throughout the year you will likely find as it gets warmer or cooler your cost-per-unit increases due to additional climate control requirements. If you are like some of our customers you may have set up power purchasing agreements directly with utilities or through an energy aggregator. Depending on your agreement you might be charged more for peak usage, which adds further cost variability. Your cost-per-unit at peak usage times would be higher than non-peak. Labor Another major contribution to your cost per unit is labor. On a basic level this can simply be the sum of the total cost of each operator on the line per hour x the number of hours per shift. Depending on the makeup of your production crews this cost can vary. One way to reduce variability would be to structure your crews with identical skill levels on each shift. Another labor cost that might be involved is maintenance. Depending on your budget this may or may not be in the same bucket as operations, still maintenance is part of the cost-per-unit, even if indirectly. If maintenance workers are required to resolve a downtime issue the cost-per-unit fluctuates based on how much lost production you face. Regardless of how you decide to calculate the labor component of cost-per-unit this data is likely available in an ERP system or can be made available in a database accessible to your enterprise intelligence system. Shipping, Inventory, Other Misc. Costs Other costs you should include are shipping, inventory, and any other miscellaneous costs incurred in getting your raw materials to the plant, processed, and shipped to the customer. Depending on your organization this information may be available in your ERP system or may need to be entered manually. Either way it can be helpful to include these costs, especially if they are variable, to get a complete picture of your cost-per-unit. Bringing It All Together Once you have identified all of the components of your cost-per-unit you need a way to calculate the value. Luckily you can use data from your ERP system, process historian, and any manually entered data, run a query in a database and get the result. From there you can send this value over to a dashboard used by management to track costs, put it in a report that goes to the finance department to understand pricing, how SKUs are performing based on their costs, and if there are areas where resources can be saved. You can even send the number to your control room for display on your HMI so the operators know where they stand at any given time. In Summary Cost-per-unit incorporates a lot of data while giving you a valuable piece of information. It is affected by your staff, your energy consumption, and many other factors. Using cost-per-unit you can easily see the impact of downtime on profitability, which shifts are more profitable, and what times of year are more profitable. You can use this information to optimize any number of processes to maximize your profitability by reducing your cost-per-unit.

If you are lucky you might be able to get all of this done before the phone rings with some other distractions. How do people find ways to track their process, find the major issues, and get them resolved? One way is to use performance management systems such as Inductive Automations MES tools. These systems take the process data you are already collecting and provide the context necessary for the data to be useful as a decision making tool. Deciding to Do Things Differently The decision to implement a performance monitoring system can seem daunting. The cost of buying the software, the time involved in configuring things, learning a new system and integrating it into your workflow. While there are some costs associated with the system both in terms of time and resources, these systems can have a direct impact on your bottom line. One simple is example of this is by using the tools to identify and reduce the top 3 reasons for downtime in your plant, thus automatically increasing productivity. Our customers have made similar gains by decreasing processing time by identifying bottlenecks and reducing re-work and scrap by identifying faulty equipment. In this series we will focus on Inductive Automations MES tools. We will answer some common questions about what MES is, what it isn't, and discuss of the direct benefits our customers have found after using the tools. If you are looking at similar solutions from other companies, we will cover those in a future series. We have worked with similar tools from most of the major companies and will do a compare and contrast post after we have gone into some detail across the board. To summarize, performance management systems give you the ability to ask questions about your operation while at the same time giving you the information you need to answer those questions and prioritize improvements. The give you an honest assessment of your plant's health. While this may be difficult to stomach, if your plant needs some help wouldn't you want to know exactly what to fix to make it better?

The difference with Inductive Automation is their approach to licensing, installing software, and configuring the system. Inductive Automation's approach to software takes a more modern approach than some of the other platforms. Instead of purchasing separate software packages for different functionality you simply need various modules to enable functionality in your system. These modules are installed in conjunction with their Ignition HMI/SCADA Solution, providing you with a seamless interface to configure communications, data analysis tools, reporting, and your production model. This approach simplifies the process of getting your MES tools up and running. The Central Nervous System of Inductive Automation MES At the heart of the MES backend is Ignition. Ignition provides you with HMI/SCADA functionality, communication with your process control system, and the requisite hooks into your database of choice. Installing the MES modules adds functionality to the Ignition interface, allowing you to configure your production model and perform various calculations in the same interface you are already familiar with. The first module you will likely start with is the OEE module. This enables you to calculate your Overall Equipment Effectiveness, track downtime, production scheduling, manage work orders and product codes, and display this information in dashboards and reports. Modeling your Process With the OEE module you will configure a production model for your plant, encompassing various facilities, sites, process areas, production lines, cells, etc. Cells are comprised of various pieces of equipment on the plant floor. In a packaging work cell at a food and beverage facility you may have a former, a filler, a sealer, and a metal detector. You can track downtime, throughput, cycle time, and events for each piece of equipment in your work cell. The OEE module also allows you to enter your production schedules, shifts, and planned downtime. Utilizing your actual production schedules allows you to analyze data by shift, crew, and by date giving you the ability to further understand how your entire plant, including personnel, is doing. By utilizing cells and production scheduling to model your facility you can use The MES tools to get a detailed view of every piece of equipment in your entire facility during all of your scheduled production runs. You also have the ability to monitor how each piece of equipment contributes to your process losses. This removes operator error in tracking process upsets compared to a manual data entry system and gives you a true view of the health of your plant. The OEE module uses real-time data to trigger downtime start/end times, track throughput, and changes in cycle times. This allows you to configure complex conditions for tracking downtime including when upstream or downstream issues cause production losses at any point in the process. Each event can be edited allowing to update notes, override downtime reasons, and manage any other data you might need. Communicating With Your Process With other MES platforms this is where we would discuss how to get data into your MES system. With Inductive Automation this is already done for you as part of the Ignition installation. This approach simplifies the configuration process, making it easy to get started on process optimization. A Full-Service Performance Platform The power of Inductive Automation's MES suite does not end here. In addition to OEE, they offer Statistical Process Control (SPC), Instrument Interface to collect serial/text information, Recipe Management and Changeover, and Track and Trace modules. These allow you to handle anything your process might throw at you, giving you the ability to easily track all of the information you need to bring your processes to the highest level. We will cover some of the other MES modules in future posts. For now just be aware that Inductive Automation's approach to MES is changing the game by providing powerful, easy-to-use, and simple to implement tools making MES something every plant can easily implement as part of their optimization strategy.

Through dashboard elements, trends, reports, and KPIs all of your data is able to be used at any level of your organization. Analyzing Your Data All of the information from the MES modules is available to view using the built-in analysis tools. These include reports with various types of trends and charts, Pareto charts, KPIs, dashboard elements, and tabular data views. Automatic drill-down functionality is available where applicable giving you easy access to your information at any level of detail you need. You can generate PDF reports from your information including the same controls available in the analysis screens, giving you the ability to automatically keep key personnel up to date on your process' health. All of the analysis tools utilize various filters, including product codes, date ranges, work orders, cells, etc. This enables you to easily narrow down your information to exactly what you want to see, when you want to see it. Accessing Your Information With Ignition's unlimited client access licensing, configuring access to your information and reports is much simpler than in other platforms. To access any of the reports, dashboards, or trends you can simply open a web browser, navigate to the Ignition application and have access to everything. You can even do this on mobile devices. Taking advantage of the concept of connecting the shop floor to the top floor is simple with Ignition. You can create user accounts in the system and give various departments access to different portions of the application. Maybe the C-Level staff only need to see a daily summary report with KPIs instead of tables of detailed process data. When they log into the system they will be shown buttons to take them to the screens relevant to them, while the operators will be taken to different screens. Should anyone need to see other screens you can enable their accounts as necessary. The main benefit to this approach is everyone will have access to the latest and greatest version of everything every time they log into the system. Wrapping Up If you can imagine it you can build it using Inductive Automation's Ignition platform with their MES modules. You can easily make changes as your system and information needs grow without having to worry about what licenses are available for developing new features. If you want to add functionality you simply install a new module rather than a new software platform with its own communication requirements, interfaces, and tech support. The same tools you have been using to manage your process are the same ones you will continue to use moving forward. If you haven't considered Inductive Automation before you should take a look at their refreshing approach to the industrial automation software world.

Like other performance management systems Inductive Automation turns your process' data into information allowing you to increase production and quality, and reduce costs by using existing equipment and labor more effectively. Going beyond other platforms, Inductive Automation's tools give you the ability to work in the applications you are already familiar with, and provide easy access to you information without licensing hassles. Adding new functionality only requires a new module, not having to learn a new software platform. Inductive Automation's MES suite takes the burden of tracking down your data and performing the calculations to summarize production losses, downtime, and OEE off of your shoulders, freeing you to tackle the tasks you need to focus on to succeed. Quick to Implement As part of the Ignition platform, the MES modules are extremely easy to implement. Once they software is installed you can be up and running with useful information in a matter of minutes instead of hours or days. Leveraging your understanding of your production lines and schedules, implementing cells, your production model, and process events can be a one time procedure giving you full access to everything you need to realize the benefits or can be broken up into phases giving you the ability to scale the system as you become more familiar with its capabilities. Easy to Maintain Once the system is up and running you should never have to worry about it again, that is until you want to expand the system to more areas of your process. When that time comes it is as simple as configuring new portions of your production model. All of your data will then be available through your reports and dashboards with no additional effort on your part. Flexible and Reliable An Inductive Automation MES system can be as small or as large as you need it to be. As your plant grows your need for information will expand as well. The modules give you the ability to use the same system as the rest of your process to easily collect all of your data and more easily access all of the information using the analysis tools you are already familiar with. Inductive Automation offers a powerful set of tools you can use to improve your operations without having to invest lots of resources in expansion and engineering. Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or would like to understand how these tools can give you the information you've been looking for to take your plant to the next level.

We don't think it ever needs to get to that point. You should never regret your decision to work with a supplier Our philosophy when it comes to relationships with our customers is simple. You should never feel obligated or forced to call us to fix something. You should only call us because you like working with us, we treat you well, you call us because we will help you, and you want us to be the ones on the other end of the line. We stand behind our work and will always be happy to fix any issues you find and will pick up the phone and give you any support you may need. Obviously there are some limitations around warranties so we may need to send you an invoice once all is said and done, still we don't want you to feel like your only option is to call us because you have no other choice. Too many times we have worked with customers who called us in out of sheet desperation. They had it up to \"here\" with their current supplier, they got too busy to provide support or simply had disappeared off the face of the earth. The worst cases are usually 10 years later when some proprietary component has gone bad and the integrator is telling them it is either a full rip and replace with a new proprietary system or nothing. We do not believe in this form of lock-in. You should call us because you enjoy working with us, not because we are your only option. If for whatever reason you think we failed to hold up our end of the bargain please let us know as soon as possible to give us a chance to rectify it. If we can't make it better we will at least make it as pain free as possible for you moving forward. We'll hold on to your code in case you need a backup. We'll spend a reasonable amount of effort answering questions on any of our custom software, and we go to great effort to write easy-to-follow code in the first place. If you need help finding someone else we will give you some recommendations. You paid for your system, you worked along side us putting in the same blood, sweat, and tears we did. The last thing you should ever think is that you wasted your time and resources. We work hard to make it easier for you to do your job. We are only successful when you are and we don't celebrate until we are cracking open some beers with you after a project is over. All of our lines of work can be hard enough when everyone gets along, we think it is easy to bond over the trials and tribulations and look to form long-lasting friendships with the people with whom we share the long hours. When the time is right we like to play as hard as we work. We want you to come have fun with us. We can only do that if we can both pick up the phone and be excited to talk to each other.

Let's take a look at why and how we are working to change that fact. The World is Moving Quickly With mobile devices in everyone's pocket and the Internet of Things becoming the next buzzword, it is time to take a look at the state of most automation software and one of the ways we have brought our customers' automated systems up to speed with the rest of their technological lives. Last week we were wrapping up the final portions of a project with a customer who was using Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk ViewPoint package for web-based access to their HMI system. ViewPoint works very well for this use case and the customer was satisfied with the investment in the software, but we ran into one small issue. One of the maintenance staff members tried to open the ViewPoint site on his phone and was quickly stopped in his tracks when Apple's iOS wouldn't let him use Microsoft Silverlight. The easiest, and suggested by Rockwell, solution to this problem was to open a remote desktop session app on the phone to access a computer on the control system network and use its web browser to access the HMI screens. This technically works but unless you have a server set up for remote access you will be limited to one person accessing the site on a mobile device at a time. After less than a minute of discussion we determined the most common use case for this system would be severely hampered by this setup and needed a work-around. Spinning the Web Some software platforms such as Inductive Automation's Ignition or Siemens' WinCC OA platform give you the ability to easily access your data on a mobile device. For other platforms where this is more difficult, or for systems with a panel-based HMI where the customer needs better trending/reporting functionality we have a solution. Our solution uses the existing information infrastructure at a lot of facilities to expose data to mobile devices, with a single site accessible on any device from a desktop PC to a tablet or smartphone, automatically displaying information in an easy to use way. The Flow of Information A very simplified diagram describes the flow of information through the system: The user opens their web browser and accesses the server where the website is being hosted. Typically this is on a server in a corporate datacenter with access to the control system data stored in a process historian. The web server takes various parameters such as a date range, tag/datapoint selection, etc., and uses an ODBC connection to a process historian to get the data the user wants to see. The historian is continuously collecting data from the process. In some cases, direct access to the controls network needs to be restricted for security reasons. In this case the process data required for the we-based system can be stored in a separate database accessible to the web server. Data from the historian is then displayed in the interface in various ways using different tools and controls available in the browser. As a general rule the functionality of these controls is very flexible, giving you the ability to display and interact with your information in almost any way you might need. Tools of the Trade A seemingly endless number of tools exist to display your process data in useful ways, turning it into information you can use to inform yourself of process conditions at any point in time. These include advanced trending tools giving you the ability to mix different graph types with one another, display discrete events with detailed information available as tooltips, the ability to save trend settings, the trend to an image, the data to Excel or CSV, and just about anything else you might wnat to do with your data. Other common tools are searchable and sortable tables with the ability to re-order columns, dashboard elements, scheduling layout tools, and email/SMS notifications. One of the powerful features of web-based systems is the ability to easily tie together different systems in compelling ways. A system we recently developed displayed process values on a trend with alarms and events shown on the trend. Hovering over an alarm on the trend displays a tooltip with the timestamp, information about the alarm, and highlights the corresponding alarm in a table view of all of the alarms below the trend. Other examples are displaying data from other business systems on the same page with process data. Product quality data can be mapped to production runs giving you additional insight into how your process conditions affect quality. Production scheduling data can be displayed alongside scheduled maintenance to optimize work load during downtimes. Just about any information you use can be displayed in new and interesting ways not currently available in most off the shelf software packages. Closing the Loop To help solve our customers' issue with ViewPoint we recreated the HMI screen more than one person would need to access simultaneously on a phone in a web-based format. This page displays their process tank levels with animated levels and volume displays. The site gets the current levels from the process historian, automatically updates the values every second and is accessible by anyone with a user account from any device they have on hand. The page automatically scales to any device and gave the customer exactly the functionality they needed with only a couple hours of development time from concept to production. Wrapping Up This is a fairly basic overview of the process required to develop a web-based interface for your process information. For more examples of solutions we have implemented please check out some of our case studies on Production Management and Change Management systems, or contact us and we can give you a demo of some of the live systems our customers are using to view their process data on all of their devices.

They replaced a set of billboards held over from the Chicago marathon last spring touting the benefits of some brightly colored running shoes. The shoes have been replaced with brightly colored sports cars and the product they are selling is Product Lifecycle Management software. I’m not entirely sure why they picked this particular stretch of road for these signs. The billboards are right above a White Castle burger and a building that housed 3 restaurants and a cell phone store before it went up in flames a couple months ago. It could be related to the convention center a mile away except the taxis would not generally drive past that block in either direction. Whatever the reason for these signs, it provides a good launching point to discuss product life cycle management (PLM). PLM is basically a formalized process to manage the process a product takes from the initial spark of an idea, to design, testing and validation, manufacturing, all the way through customer use, support, and eventually retirement and disposal. PLM defines the various workflows, documentation, collaboration, and supply chains required to create complex and/or large scale products. Always Growing With automation basically ubiquitous at this point, more and more companies are looking at ways to optimize these processes. This is where things like <bManufacturing Execution ( MES ) or Manufacturing Operations Management Systems ( MOM ) come into play. These systems find ways to increase production efficiency, reduce downtime, and reduce overall costs. These systems can be extremely beneficial to the manufacturing portion of a product’s lifecycle, yet generally don’t carry over their benefits into the entirety of an organization. This is where PLM comes into its own, using the same goals of MES/MOM systems applied to the entire company. Pieces of the Pie If you were think about MES/MOM in terms of the automation pyramid concept in the framework of a PLM system, the pyramid would simply be one portion of the whole ecosystem , focused only on the manufacturing portion of the product’s lifecycle. There are similar concepts at play in every component of the PLM system each requiring workflows , processes , and information to optimize their output. Each member of the development and production team generates data and information that can be useful for the rest of the team: Design can inform how something is manufactured End-users can inform manufacturing of defects which can trickle down to find root causes Scheduling can be informed by market demand ...and many more Wrapping Up We have developed systems to help our customers adopt product lifecycle management systems into their workflow and have seen how companies have used these systems at very large scale, keeping thousands of people automatically updated on every aspect of the products they are creating. We’ll get into more detail on the different portions of PLM in more future posts including some real world examples. In the meantime, please let us know if you have any thoughts or questions on product lifecycle management.

Our customer manufactures irrigation systems used all over the world. They use an in-house control system with panel mounted operator interfaces. Given the sometimes remote location of some of their installations, they need remote access to each system’s information, process conditions, etc. The panels have a built-in solution that gets the job done, minus an easy way to access data more than an hour old. “Gets the job done” is very far from “easy-to-use”, “looks amazing”, and “changes industry expectations”. Our system gives the end user more functionality than the existing interface, looks great, and challenges incumbent ideas about what is acceptable for a baseline product. If that is all the project entailed it would make a great case study with some pretty screenshots and a good testimonial. Luckily it isn’t the end of the story. With the new information infrastructure from this project in place some interesting possibilities start to emerge: What if someone owns multiple irrigation systems and wants to track water and power usage against their utility bills across all of their systems? What if our customer wants to collect data to spin up a predictive maintenance program? Those weekly and monthly reports being sent to local municipalities? Why not generate the reports and send email them to the right people automatically? What about automatic leak detection alerts sent to a maintenance crew’s cell phones via text message? As the number of installs increases the possibilities can go even further. What changed to enable these new possibilities? Technology? Check. Connectivity? Check. Collaboration? Check. These pale in comparison to the real driver of change: A new way of thinking. Thinking of things as one of many instead of only one enabled new possibilities. Multiple sets of data brings new connections, new information. Sharing this information enables new ideas, new ways of accomplishing the same things and more.

Our customers, the world. Born in today's connected world, we made a decision early on to save ourselves the expense of a large office, and instead investing in our people . During our last startup someone asked us how in the world we get anything done with our people working wherever they want. Not only do we get things done, we think our approach has some huge advantages, even easing our burden on our customers' bottom line . Our philosophy is simple. Most of our time is spent on development/testing, not at a customer facility. This can be done anywhere there is electricity. What about the other 16 hours in the day? No one on our team works in a personal vaccuum. Family, spouses, volunteering, school, regional activities, and any number of other things all influence where someone's ideal living situation is physically located. A Venn Diagram of everyone's personal influences, access to electricity, and our HQ in Chicago is skewed away from one of those constraints. Not requiring our people to live in the same place has some amazing benefits. We are no longer limited to the best people, who want to live in Chicago, we are simply limited to the best people , period. Travel, the Environment, Sanity One of our customer's facilities is in Nevada. It makes more sense for everyone to send someone from California to their plant than someone from Florida. Cheaper transportation costs, less environmental impact, and they can go home on the weekend if they want. Our line of work can be difficult and stressful at times. We have all worked at a company who amplifies those traits. Removing as much stress as possible keeps our people happier, more productive, and ready to tackle the next challenge. Communication is Key This whole idea would crumble without a solid communication infrastructure in place. We use a variety of tools to manage our projects, our people, and our training. Here is a non-exhaustive list: Skype Google Hangouts Github Basecamp, Trello, Internal project management tools Insightly P2 by Wordpress Dropbox, Google Drive, Box Heroku, Azure, Amazon Web Services Internal Wikis This workflow has given us and our customers a completely unexpected benefit. We can easily give our customers access to their projects in these systems. No more wondering where things stand, simply login and take a look or get an email anytime there is a status update. Our customers can also be a part of the project process by leaving notes, asking questions, and doing reviews using the same tools we use in our workflow. This streamlines communications, leaving us to focus on the things that matter most to our customers without wasting any of their time. Setting Expectations The other tool we use on every project is to explicitly set and understand expectations on both sides of the table. If you are working with us you will know how we are going to approach your project, who will be working on it, the scope of work, what issues we expect to face, and the resources and information we expect from you. Spending this time up front saves a great deal of time during the life of the project and prevents many of the common headaches and pitfalls we have run into while employed by other companies in the past. Wrapping Up Our decision was simple. Most of our time is spent off-site doing development or support. We are typically on-site during the beginning and end of a project for meetings and commissioning. On-site is usually a plane ride away so why worry about all sitting in the same room all the time? The short answer is, we don't. Instead we focus on taking care of our people, our customers, and our families. With a strong foundation the rest is easy .

Nevermind the number of things telling you about what the latest health scare, what does or doesn't give you cancer this week, and how to find investment $$$ for your latest idea. What about your work life? How the Internet of Things is coming to connect everything under the sun. There is a new technology you aren't using for project/people/process management, or how you should remove your org chart in favor of a flat corporate structure. How do you make sense of what you should adopt , what is hype , and what you should avoid entirely ? If you had infinite time and resources you could give everything a test-run to see what sticks. Unfortunately most of us are not in that position. How do people like us manage growth without interrupting what is already working? Our Approach We are constantly bombarded with new software versions and new operational methodologies. Our job is to first sift through all of these things and find what we think will fit with our customers' needs so we can provide them with the tools they can best utilize. The first thing we do when assessing a new idea is to appropriately set our expectations for what it can do. Until we have hands on experience suggesting otherwise we scale back marketing promises . 99.9% of the time the reality of a product is somewhere between zero and where the marketing material says it is. With a conservative estimate of what the product will deliver we can dive into step 2. We take our estimated benefits and value of a product and spend a little time imagining how it will impact our workflow, and integrate with our customers' systems. We also take into account any potential pitfalls with existing systems as well as seek out new potential pitfalls with a new system. The trick here is to take an 80/20 approach by spending a small amount of time on a thought exercise to understand where we think the end result will be. Notice at this point we have not spent any money, invested any development time, or integrated anything. A lot of times we can stop here. A new product may not integrate well with existing systems, might introduce new shortcomings without addressing existing ones, or simply may not be in the wheelhouse of what will benefit our customers. If the results of the thought experiment intrigue us we will invest time in actually learning the software. This gives us a deeper understanding of the capabilities and either confirms or denies our hunches about functionality, shortcomings, and overall value. Again, the goal here is to spend a small amount of time learning without investing in a full-scale deployment . If the idea makes it through this phase we can be confident in its ability to provide value and we will add it to our repertoire. Keeping in mind the idea of the 80/20 principle we can then move onto the next step. To Do...Check Now we are confident in the idea or product. This is the time to start finding where it fits into your to-do list. If it is something with a low overall cost and a high impact it would likely be at the top. If instead it takes education, has high costs, or other hurdles preventing it from being a slam-dunk it will go towards the middle or bottom of the list while those hurdles are overcome. When it comes time to make the investment in the new technology we take a similar approach with a small investment up front to understand the overall impact, only it is a step further as we have already vetted a lot of the risks and rewards. Rinse and Repeat Before we would ever suggest someone do a full-scale implementation of a new technology we will start with a pilot version. For an MES system this might be tracking 5% of your total process, for a QA/QC system this would be a handful of tests our of many, or for equipment integration it would mean starting with the first portion of the line only. The goal here is to walk our customer through the process outlined above with their involvement and investment. If the pilot program works, only then would we suggest expanding to a full implementation. If for some reason it doesn't work out we can take another approach without having invested a lot of time and resources on an experiment. Wrapping Up Our approach is pretty simple. It is based on the scientific method where we come up with a hypothesis, \"Is this going to do what the brochure says?\", and run some experiments to give us an answer. From there we do more experiments and as the data provides a more complete picture we put more faith in the tools if they are working, or can quickly adapt and use a new approach if they are not working.

For an industrial facility this includes instrumentation, equipment, and PLC’s. It also includes maintaining instrument calibrations, PLC programs and various other device configurations and settings. For facilities using the a wide range of PLC platforms, FactoryTalk AssetCentre is a powerful tool to manage all of these functions and more. Disaster Recovery One of the strongest arguments for using AssetCentre is for its disaster recovery capabilities. Someday you will have a PLC that loses power, along with a dead battery with the latest and greatest version of the program sitting in a box in someone’s office. Until you can find and reload the backup program, your process is down and you are losing money and productivity by the second. If you had been using AssetCentre the amount of downtime you would experience in that situation would be greatly reduced. AssetCentre stores the as-built version of the program in its version control system and periodically scans the network checking for changes to the programs. When it finds changes backups are automatically created, always keeping the most up-to-date version of your code on hand. Latest and Greatest In addition to PLC program backups, AssetCentre provides an audit trail letting you know who is making changes to programs and when they are being made. This is accomplished with a software version control system. The original code is stored in AssetCentre. To make changes your staff “check-out” the latest version of the code, make changes, test and commission the changes, and then “check-in” the code, updating the database with timestamps and information on who made the changes. AssetCentre not only stores PLC programs under version control but any electronic file such as AutoCAD Drawings, Microsoft Excel files, and many others. AssetCentre simplifies the process of instrument calibration. You can store calibration settings, procedures, personnel information, labor time and calibration test results. You also get access to historical information on changes to calibrations and when they were performed. Similar functionality is built-in for device configurations such as I/O modules, control valves, and various other devices. Automated In addition to storing programs, software, instrument calibrations, and device configurations, AssetCentre has reporting capabilities to keep your staff informed on changes to the system, results of network scans and reminders for when instrument calibrations need to take place. AssetCentre allows you to build a tree based representation of all of your assets making them easy to navigate and manage. This also makes it easy to standardize your assets and add to your system as your facility grows. Wrapping Up In today’s connected world it doesn’t make sense to put your investment at risk using out-dated methods to keep everything up to date. We use similar tools when we are developing software for your facility, why not maintain things the same way?

From raw materials, through manufacturing, all the way to your end users, knowing when things go wrong as soon as possible can save you time, headaches, and avoid costly recalls. Let's dive into the first step you can take to painting a better picture of your supply chain. The Essentials A track and trace system tracks a product through all phases of manufacturing and provides a trace of the product’s lifecycle from the plant to the customer. The first step in implementing a track and trace system is assigning individual products or batches unique ID’s or serial numbers accessible with barcodes or RFID tags. When each unit enters the process its serial number and location is stored in a database. Each time it advances to the next step in the process the database is updated to reflect its location. Plant personnel can access the tracking information to easily determine where any item is on the line. An advanced tracking system monitors process conditions along with quality control data to automatically flag products as defective as they advance through the process. Traceability relates to the production history of each unit or batch. This includes information across the supply chain from raw materials to where each unit is shipped to once it leaves the factory. This allows you to pinpoint where quality issues originated and simplifies the process of doing product recalls. Benefits Implementing a track and trace system helps you: Improve overall process quality and efficiency by exposing error-prone portions of the process Reduce recall expenses by knowing exactly where each unit or batch was shipped Expose inconsistencies in raw materials Reduce re-work and reject batches by catching quality issues as they occur Increase process visibility for plant personnel The rubber meets the road One example of a track and trace system in action is our case study on upgrading a slot machine manufacturing company's conveyor system . Here we used RFID tags embedded into pallets to track each machine as it moved through the process, sending it to a rework area if rework was required, or required parts were no longer in inventory. Track and trace is one of the first steps you can take towards the implementation of a full Product Lifecycle Management system.

You can access just about anything in the world on your phone, soon even your wrist. In the manufacturing world computer hardware has overcome the requirements of most software packages. This means when you need to buy a new computer, instead of running it to the max like you would have 3 or 4 years ago, you may only be using 10-20% of the hardware's capacity. Companies like VMWare and Microsoft have developed a way to utilize the unused resources using virtual machines . Virtual Machines are computers running on software designed to imitate physical hardware. In the same way you can run multiple programs at one time on your PC, with virtual machines, you can run multiple computers on one PC — at the same time . Virtual machines used in this way let you: Utilize more of your hardware's resources Consolidate multiple physical computers into one Swap between computers with no downtime Decrease IT Overhead When you need to set up a new machine, you call IT, requisition the hardware, and let them spend a day or two installing all of the software you need. With a virtual machine you can get a new computer up and running by simply copying a file and opening it. Have an old computer you need for only one piece of equipment? Replace it with a virtual machine Need multiple versions of your software but they don't play well together? Use virtual machines Want to test a new software version without breaking anything? Do it with a virtual machine Leveraging Virtual Machines What systems do you need to maintain your process effectively? Maybe you have different PLCs throughout the plant, different HMI systems, or some specialty software for calibrating instruments. This is the situation we find ourselves in every day. Different customers have different systems and we need to be able to support any of them at a moment's notice. Staying up to date with the latest releases is critical, and dealing with different versions of software without breaking existing installations can be a nightmare. Virtual machines eliminate these problems entirely. We have virtual machines ready to go for any software we use. If we want to start working with a new package, we have machines with clean operating systems ready to go. If a new software release is incompatible with an old version we create a new virtual machine to support it. Think of us like a maintenance department covering a very wide array of systems. Would you want to make your maintenance department's life easier, with very little cost? Look into virtual machines.

Jaxon implemented Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk software suite for robust operator control of the plant and secure remote access to real-time information. \"We have worked with other integrators in the past, but Corso took the time to understand our needs , and proposed a solution that was custom designed just for us. The system made our lives easier and enabled us to do more than we could in the past.\" - Randy Soule, Co-Owner, Jaxon Energy The Process Hydrotreating is a process removing contaminates from light end distillates generated as part of petroleum refining. Distillates are subjected to pressures and temperatures then filtered through catalyst agents with hydrogen gas to remove contaminants. The cleaned petroleum oil is fractionated into diesel and gasoline products. Contaminates are thermally destroyed in oxidizers resulting in no remaining residue or byproducts . Most refineries choose not to upgrade these stranded light end petroleum distillates due the low volume produced at any single facility. The Jaxon Energy business model aggregates stranded distillates from multiple refineries or other producers to achieve economically viable volumes of raw material. The Challenge This plant's sister facilities have a DCS as the foundation of their control systems. Due to the high initial investment, ongoing difficulties in maintaining DCS systems, and the volatile economic landscape of the oil industry, Jaxon Energy decided to move to a PLC-based system for this facility. The new system had to offer similar functionality to the DCS system in the operator interface, enable safe operation of the facility, provide powerful data collection and analysis tools. The control system, in conjunction with proper catalysts had to be flexible enough to handle almost any usable raw material to produce a wide range of finished products. . Changes to Jaxon Energy's operational model with this facility required remote access to all components of the system , for both operations management and maintenance planning. In addition, Jaxon Energy's business model required remote access to product quality information, operating parameters, and dissemination of raw vs. finished material reports to their suppliers and customers. The Strategy \"This was a big project and we made a lot of changes with this facility. Repeating what we had done in the past simply wasn't going to cut it.\" - Randy Soule - Co-Owner, Jaxon Energy To save on investment, startup, and ongoing maintenance costs, Jaxon Energy decided to use a PLC and HMI based control system built on the Allen Bradley and Rockwell Automation product lines, leveraging the FactoryTalk software suite. In addition Corso Systems designed a custom, web-based solution for material tracking and QA/QC information. This gave operators a way to log quality data and enabled plant management to understand their process on a deeper level and make smarter decisions. This platform also gave Jaxon Energy a fully integrated system with more power than the DCS they had used in the past, at less than half the cost. One of Jaxon's design requirements was to use standard instruction sets and graphics for their process equipment. This requirement was met with Rockwell's PlantPAX framework. PlantPAX enables standard graphics, including detailed interlock status directly in the HMI, standard logic in the PLC, and gave Jaxon Energy a familiar, yet more user-friendly , look and feel to systems in use at their other plants. FactoryTalk Historian & VantagePoint was chosen as a powerful information and analytics system, meeting Jaxon's requirements for Excel reporting while adding remote access to their information. Remote access to the HMI with full visual capabilities was accomplished using Rockwell's FactoryTalk ViewPoint software. The final piece of the puzzle was a custom solution built by Corso System on the ASP.NET MVC platform, giving Jaxon the ability to track incoming raw material shipments, in-process material, and finished product shipments. The system tracks the amount of material in any portion of the process, while also enabling LIMS functionality to track material conditions and quality . The Results Jaxon Energy is able to operate the plant 24x7 , processing up to 60,000 gallons of product a day , with only two operators on each shift. Remote access to all of the plant's systems enables Jaxon to manage operations from their Reno, NV headquarters, reducing overall operating costs. . Moving away from DCS controls saved Jaxon over 50% on initial investment costs, with reduced start-up/commissioning duration & increased functionality. The PLC/HMI, FactoryTalk Historian & VantagePoint, combined with the product tracking/LIMS system, give Jaxon a fully-integrated solution. Raw material is tracked from the supplier, all the way through to the final customer, with automatic Bill of Lading generation, production reporting, and quality evaluation notifications for key engineering staff. \"Corso Systems raised the bar on what we expect from our partners.\" - Ron Bell, Director of Operations, Jaxon Energy For information on other ways we have helped companies like Jaxon Energy: Check Out Our Case Studies ","summary":null,"detail_summary":null,"focus":null,"drive":null,"results":null,"technology":null,"benefits":null},{"title":"Simple - Save yourself time, resources, and hassle","url":"/blog/simple","date":"2015-05-04 00:00:00 -0500","categories":["blog"],"body":"While researching and writing the first parts of an upcoming series on the High Performance HMI methodology, a theme emerged.

What Does Visibility Look Like In Practice? Whether you're starting up or have been running your operation for years, your process will eventually drive you towards SCADA/MES/MOM systems. Manufacturing Execution Systems are the glue that tie your process together. Everything from process data, to scheduling, to your ERP system will work as one. MES systems take your raw data and turn it into information you can use to make better decisions to run your operation. Imagine sitting down at your desk, logging into a dashboard and seeing everything you need to know about your business in one screen, as well as the health of your process relative to the rest of your business. Identify Opportunities To Reduce Costs One of the easiest ways to reduce operational costs is to build transparency into your process. What if everyone who was entitled to inventory and material levels had access to it remotely along with other process data? What if everyone responsible for managing your organization was looking at the same picture of your process? Giving the right people the right data, at the right time is what drives smart decision making. In order to deliver industry and customer specific solutions, staying on top of KPIs is crucial, and a white-board isn't going to give you information back. Putting It All Together While these concepts can be overwhelming, implementing SCADA and MES systems can be a painless process that doesn't break the bank. With recent developments in web-based and cloud technologies, customized solutions work in tandem with the industry standard infrastructure you already have in place to give you a bird's eye view of your business. Think of these customized solutions as adding a layer on top of your existing infrastructure. Visualize A More Efficient Business The beauty of cloud-based solutions is that they're as flexible as you need them to be. Better visibility of your process can look however you would like it to look. Anything from a simple dashboard that can be accessed from from your phone or computer with basic information you want to see, to a rich site with real-time data, trends, and notifications that are pushed to your phone based on custom parameters you set. The possibilities are endless and are only limited by your imagination, and the resources you have around you.

One assumption is you already have some experience with web development, or are willing to dive into a few potentially new concepts. We won't be breaking down the fundamentals of web development here, just showing what you need to know to get data into the various formats required for the pages to work properly. This article, the first of the series, will cover configuring the web server and show you how to implement trends in a custom web page using the S7-1200 and S7-1500's built-in datalogs for historical data. Why is this useful? For many OEM systems, using a built-in web server in a PLC can save on hardware costs, software costs, and give you a flexible and powerful way to interact with your equipment. You can avoid the hassle of maintaining a database for storing historical data and still give your users access to the information they need to operate most effectively. By using web-based development frameworks, you can quickly develop a state-of-the-art, eye-popping system to give you a huge head start on some of the other interface options available to you. What is a web server? A web server is simply software you can access with a web-browser. It acts as the gateway between your browser and any underlying systems such as a database, and returns information to you in the form of a web-site. When you access your favorite news site, their web server generates the articles and sends them to your browser. When you configure the web server in your S7-1200 or S7-1500 PLC, it will give you access to datalogs, custom configured web pages you can use for trends, HMI functionality, dashboards, or even recipes. Let's dive into the process of configuring the web server in your PLC and show you how to use it in some powerful ways. Enabling the web server The first step is to enable the web server. After opening your application, go to your PLC's Device Configuration menu, select the Web server item in the tree, and check \"Activate Web server on all modules on this device\". Compile your project and download to the processor: After you have enabled the web server and downloaded to the PLC you can access the default page by navigating to your PLC's IP address in your browser. Using the default website, you can view the Diagnostic Buffer for your PLC: and you can access any data log files you may have stored in the PLC: The real power of the web server comes into play when you enable user pages, or custom HTML pages you can use to interact with your PLC data, and generate things like trends and dashboard controls for detailed data analysis in your browser. Enabling user pages The first thing you need to do is create a directory to hold your user pages. In this case we are using a folder called S7_1200_Web on the C:\\ drive. Create an HTML file in this directory and put some HTML in so we can verify everything is working properly. For testing this can be the following: Save the HTML file as index.html and go back to your project. Scroll about halfway down to the Web Server menu in the Device Configuration tab to \"User-Defined Web Pages\" and enter the directory where your user pages are stored. Also enter the name of the default page, in this case we will use index.html. You can also enter your application name which will become part of the URL used to access your user pages. You will also need to add the file extensions we will be using to the \"Advanced\" section to enable to PLC to generate the proper program blocks so you can access your pages. Typically these will be either .htm or .html, for html pages and .js for javascript files. Enter these extensions in the \"Files with dynamic content\" box under \"Advanced\" By default the PLC will use DB333 and DB334 and so on to store the contents of your user pages. As you add more pages to the directory it will increment the DB number as necessary. If you would like to use a different DB number you can configure these in the \"Advanced\" section of the Web server configuration, just below the \"User Pages\" section. Once you have filled out these sections, click the \"Generate Blocks\" button to generate the program blocks the PLC will use to store the HTML from your user pages. You will then see the program blocks created, in this case DB333 and DB334 The final step to enable user pages is to add the WWW function to your logic. Specify your Web DB number, in this case 333, and a tag for the return value, then compile and download to the processor. Once you have downloaded your logic with the WWW function, you will see a link to the default user page under \"User Pages\" on the PLC's default web page. You can also navigate to the page directly with the following URL format: http://{ip address of PLC}/awp/{Application Name}/{User Page}.html, or for our PLC http://192.168.0.1/awp/WebDev/index.html Navigating to the page will display the HTML page you requested, in this case we will see a basic trend configured based on a data log file in the PLC. This functionality will be covered later in this article. Building Powerful User Pages With user pages enabled in the PLC's web server, we can now expand into a lot of different areas. Dashboards, reports, trends, API's, the list goes on. What you choose to do with your pages is entirely dependent on your needs, and we will cover some of the common use cases we have implemented on most of the web-based systems we have developed over the years. General Concepts While it is possible to include all of your HTML and Javascript/jQuery code in your user pages directory and on the PLC itself, you might find it beneficial to host the files on another machine on the network, or use a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver the files you need for client-side functionality. Including these files directly in the PLC can cause to large amounts of memory usage, potentially impacting your data logging capabilities. Hosting this files on a different machine or CDN alleviates these issues and can also speed up the load time of your pages. This article will demonstrate how to use a CDN to deliver the jQuery libraries we will be using. In line with hosting libraries outside of the PLC, we have found hosting a Javascript file on another machine and updating it during development saves a lot of time compared to generating blocks for user pages, compiling, downloading the processor, and rebooting every time a change is made. Using a different machine allows you to edit the Javascript file on the machine, save it, and simply refresh the browser to update the page with any changes. This results in a significant time savings over the course of developing and testing a full application. We will cover the various functionality components below, in no particular order. At this point you can jump around the article to find what interests you most and work through the exercise without a whole lot of overlap between sections. Basic Trending If you are using the data log functionality of the S7-1200 or the S7-1500, one powerful tool you can use in your user pages is trending. Given the relative simplicity of most web servers, including the one in our PLC, we will focus on implementing client based trending tools through the use of Javascript and jQuery. There are a variety of frameworks you can use for this, D3, High Charts, Google Charts, or our framework of choice Flot Charts. They all have their pros and cons, some including license ramifications, open-source vs. closed source, and free vs. paid. We have found Flot Charts to work extremely well for our needs, typically trending time-stamped process data. If you have any questions about our experience with any of the tools we have used, please feel free to reach out and ask. The basic overview of this section is we will generate a date/time range using date/time pickers on the page. When the user selects the date range and clicks the \"Update\" button we will request a list of data log files and based on their name, including the date/time the logs began, will select the appropriate file, parse its contents into the format required by Flot and will then display the trend to the user with the correct date/time range on the X-Axis. First we will go through the process of generating a basic trend with fixed data set. From there we will get into dynamic datasets with date range selections. To demonstrate basic trending our PLC has a small log file tracking the run status of two pumps as seen below: Data logs are stored as .CSV files in the S7-1200 and S7-1500 PLCs. This format defines the value of each column in the first line, with each column separated by a comma. Subsequent lines represent values at a particular timestamp, again with each column separated by a comma. This format, while useful for storage and analysis using a program like Excel, isn't directly useful for the approach we will take to generating a trend. The first step we need to accomplish is to break down the CSV data into something Javascript can deal with more effectively. To acoomplish this, we will use a jQuery library called jQuery-CSV. This library allows us to break the CSV file down into a list of objects we can easily manipulate to work with using Javascript. Following the tip to load libraries from a CDN, we will load the library from a CDN in the header of our HTML page. Keep in mind you can use any CDN you prefer, store the file on another machine on the network, or even put it directly in the PLC as necessary. Since we will be using jQuery libraries, we will also include the jQuery library itself: We will do the same thing for the Flot Charts library, and for development purposes, the development version of the Javascript file we will use for testing. Since we are dealing with time series data, we will also include the Flot Time library, and the Moment.js library to simplify working with different date formats: For Flot to function properly, we will need to add a <div> element to our page, and specify the width and height for our trend, and give it an ID so we can refer to it later in our Javascript code: This is the basic format we need to display a single trend on a page, so we are done with our HTML page for now. Save it to your user pages folder, generate blocks, and download to the processor. We will do the rest of the work to generate a trend in the s7_Demo.js file linked to in the header. Let's go through the code used to generate a trend line by line. If you are familiar with Javascript and jQuery this will be pretty straightforward, if not it will cover the basics of what is required for this piece of functionality, and you can find plenty of resources online to go as in-depth as you like on the language as a whole. The first line of code tells the browser to execute this code only after the pages has completely loaded. This is to make sure all of the Javascript files and jQuery libraries are ready, and the page itself is loaded and ready for us to interact with it: The next section defines and AJAX call to our server. This loads data from the specified URL without the user having to interact with the page, and doesn't require the page to be refreshed. We are specifying the specific URL for our datalog file in the URL parameter, telling the server we are requesting or \"getting\" data, specifying we want expect the data to be returned as text, and are defining the function we will execute when the AJAX call as successfully completed. The next line begins the code executing once our AJAX call is complete. The first step is to take the results from our AJAX call, in this case the data in the .CSV file, and use the jQuery-CSV library to convert it to a list of objects Javascript can more easily understand. This is accomplished by calling the jQuery function to convert a CSV file into objects as described in the jQuery-CSV documentation. Once this function has executed, we can use the variable \"results\" to generate the data we will use for the trend. The next two lines as simply declaring variables we will use to store the data for each of our trend lines. The meat of our Javascript code, where we take the data from the objects we generated from the CSV file and parse them for our trend comes next. We are using a for loop to iterate over all of the objects. Within this loop we are pushing data onto the arrays we defined previously. This simply adds a new element onto each array for each object in the list. The format Flot requires for trend data is an array of elements of the form [x value, y value]. For our trend we want the x-axis to display the timestamp, and the y-axis to display the value of each dataset at that time. Flot requires the timestamp data to be in a certain format, so we will have to manipulate the data in our object appropriately. The innermost portion of this function is adding together the \"Date\" and \"UTC Time\" columns from our object, with a space separating them. This gives us a human readable timestamp of the format \"Month/Day/Year Hours:Minutes:Seconds\". To turn this into the format Flot expects (milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00) we use the simply use the parse function of the Date type in Javascript as shown below. This takes care of the x-axis value, for the y-value we specify the specific data point in our object, in this case Pump1_On or Pump2_On and include it in our elements to be pushed onto the appropriate array. The final piece of code except for closing brackets/parentheses is to generate the plot itself. To accomplish this we call the .plot() function of the Flot library. We pass the ID value of the div we created in our HTML file as the container for the trend to be put in to, specify an array of the variables we want to use for trend lines, in this case the variables we worked with in the previous section of code, and specify a mode of \"time\" for the x-axis. This generates a basic trend on our page: Advanced Trending With the basics of trending covered, let's dive into some more advanced functionality. For our purposes the next step is to add a couple of date/time pickers to our page so we can select a start and end time for our trend. This lets your users narrow down the amount of data they are viewing at any given time and allows them to easily view historical data. Much like trend tools, there are a ton of options for date, time, and both date and time selection options. These can be simple HTML dropdown controls, or more complex jQuery components with additional functionality. For this tutorial we will use a jQuery date/time picker we have found to be very mobile friendly: This date/time picker control is an add-on to an existing library of user interface controls called jQuery-UI. To make it functional we need to include the jQuery-UI library, as well as the files for this partlcular control. For the rest of this article, assume we will be adding the required lines to our existing file, to save some space we won't keep repeating previous lines of code: Notice we are also including references to two CSS files, these contain all of the styling for the various controls and will start to become more prevalent in later sections. To place a date/time picker on the page we need to add a div for each date/time picker we want to use, give it an ID so we can access it in Javascript, and then write the Javascript code we need to generate the control. Let's start with the HTML and break it down into further detail from there: This code is pretty basic, we have an input for each of the datetime pickers, and an update button we will use to trigger a page update when the user changes the date range. This code will go right below the $(function() call so it is the first thing to be executed when the page loads. This is going to be a little more involved than simply creating the date/time picker to give us additional functionality by pre-populating the pickers. The first two lines define variables and set them to a value of the current time/date. The next line sets the startDate variable's hour to one hour ago, and the next line is there for posterity in case you wanted to choose a different range than simply the previous hour. The final two lines create the date/time picker and pre-populate their values with the start and end dates, with the correct formatting specified by the Moment.js library. Now when you load the page you will have two date/time pickers, with one at the current time, and one at the current time minus an hour. With the date/time pickers set up, we can put them to use. This will be one of the more complex portions of the process so far and will cover a lot of different concepts. The basic outline is the page will load with default values for the date/time range, or user will make an adjustment to the range and click the update button. We will get a list of the datalogs and their \"last modified\" timestamp. We will figure out which datalog best matches with the date range, and load it the same way we did in the previous section. We will leave some items for your own future exploration such as more in-depth interface design and working with date/time ranges spanning multiple data logs. First we need to know when the user clicks the update button. Using jQuery this is extremely easy using the onClick() function: This code does a couple of things, it checks to make sure the date/time pickers have a value and if they do, it calls the updateTrendData() function. If they are empty it alerts the user and tells them to make a selection. We can accomplish the same functionality when the page loads by calling the updateTrendData() function after the date/time pickers have been created as in the previous section. The meat of this section is what happens in the updateTrendData() function. The first portion of this function needs to determine what datalog file we need to use to populate our trend, based on when it was last edited in relation to other datalogs that may exist. We are going to make an assumption to simplify development. The assumption is datalogs will only be modified as data is added to them, and once a new datalog has been created, we will assume its start time is later in time than the previous datalog's last modification. This allows us to use the datalog information available by default to narrow down the file we need to load without having to go into the PLC code and do anything like provide a timestamp as part of the datalog name when it is created. In this case simple is better. How do we get the timestamp data from the datalogs in the PLC? If you navigate through the built-in pages in the S7 web server you will find a list of the data logs, with an associated timestamp of when they were last modified. What we will do is load this page using an AJAX call like before so the user doesn't need to interact with the page to load the data and no page refresh is required. When the page is accessed using AJAX we can then search through the HTML to find the timestamps based on the CSS class of the table and the corresponding cell within the the table and iterate over those to build our list of timestamps. Once the list is created we can do some simple comparisons to find the closest matching datalog file and call the function to load it the same way as before. We are going to make some big assumptions for this tutorial. First, we will assume you have datalogs being generated on a regular basis. Second, we will assume your datalogs are only storing a relatively small amount of data, say 1 hour. Lastly, we are assuming you will only want to look at the data contained in one file. It is entirely possible, with some additional code, to view data from multiple files at once, use files for any length of time, and do things like \"real-time\" updates. Functionality in those areas is something we can discuss further, but are out of this article's scope. The first step is to get a list of the datalog files stored in the PLC. We will use AJAX again to accomplish this task. Navigating through the standard webpages, we find a list of data log files and the URL we can use to access the list: Using this URL in our AJAX call: Upon successfully loading the page, we will return its contents as text to our AJAX function for further parsing and manipulation. First we will declare a variable, set it equal to the response text, and wrap it up with <html> tags so we can manipulate the data with jQuery: Next we will declare variables to hold our start and end timestamps from the datetimepickers. The datalog file information is stored in a table. We will simply copy this to our page to simplify the code for this tutorial, and hide the table so it doesn't clutter up the page: Next we will iterate through the rows of the table, checking to see if the row contains a timestamp. If it does, we will parse it into the Javascript format and compare it to our start and end timestamps to see if it is in our desired range. If it is in the range we will get the filename and generate the trend, if it is not in our range we will simply move to the next row in the table. Most of this code is similar to what we have seen previously, the main difference is navigating the table. This function is called in two places. First it will be called when the page loads, and should load the latest datalog and display it on the trend. The second place it is called is when the user clicks on the \"Update\" button next to the datetimepickers. In this function we are iterating through the rows of a table. By viewing the page source in our browser, we can see what the various IDs and CSS classes each cell in the table has applied to it. Using this information we can easily find the timestamp and filename in the row using jQuery. First we will use the .find() method to determine if the timestamp cell has a valid timestamp using CSS classes, and the length of the text in the cell: If we do have a valid timestamp we wlll parse it as before and check to see if it is in our desired range. If it is, we will navigate to the filename cell in this row and pass the filename to our function to generate the trend. In the previous section we demonstrated loading a single datalog file. In this section we moved this functionality into a separate function, including variables for our date range to limit the amount of data we are loading from the datalog. This is the same code as before, wrapped up in a function, with a check on the timestamp in the datalog to see if we need to include it in our trend. We are calling this function from the updateTrend() function in the previous section. Wrapping Up Now you have the functionality in place for you to load datalogs onto your trend using a user-selectable date range. Simply changing the date range and clicking \"Update\" will go through the datalogs in the PLC, find the appropriate file and display it on the trend. Where can you go from here? One option would be to simplify the process by removing the date range selection, instead generating a table of the datalogs and allowing the user to click on a particular file to display it on the trend. Another option giving you more flexibitly along with more backend complexity would be to load data from multiple datalogs to fill your date range with any data in the PLC. A third option would be the addition of \"real-time\" trending, allowing users to see the most recent data as it is written to the PLC. The Flot website has excellent examples of this functionality, and if you have any questions on how to implement any of these ideas or any you have, we are always happy to help.

You have some hot-button items always at the top of the list. Items usually of great importance to someone else. In the middle are things important t you, and some things at the bottom that would be nice but not critical to complete. How should you prioritize your workload? One way is using Pareto Analysis. Here is an example of why a processing plant shutdown over a certain period of time: Pareto Analysis is simple. Track the number of occurrences of each downtime reason. Sort them in descending order, and put them on a bar chart, with the count on the left y-axis. Next, plot a line of each the percentage each bar contributes to the total downtime count with the value on the right y-axis. This shows you the most common causes of downtime from left to right, and the percentage they are contributing to the whole. How is this useful? Sorting information this way shows that if you cut down the 2 most downtime causes, your downtime occurences would drop 50%. To show this, draw a vertical line to the right of a bar to the percentage line. Where this line crosses the percentage line, draw a horizontal line to the right y-axis. This will give you the total percent for the downtime reasons up to that point. You can apply this method to just about any situation in your plant: Quality issues Safety incidents Maintenance issues If you are already tracking things like OEE, you can leverage Pareto Analysis tools as a drill-down option in your OEE reports. Drilling down to show the underlying root causes of quality, throughput, or cycle time issues. Another powerful way to use Pareto Analysis is to go beyond ordering by number of occurrences, and instead by duration. First, imagine you had 100 instances of downtime due to mechanical issues. Second, imagine you have 4 instances of downtime due to power failures. Let's say mechanical issues average 1 minute each, while power failures average 2 hours each. Going by number of occurrences fixing the mechanical issues would be a huge win. If instead you look at reducing the impact on total downtime, power failures have a larger impact. Wrapping Up Pareto Analysis can be a powerful tool used to help you prioritize your work load. Please feel free to reach out to us at any time if you have questions. We would be happy to show you some of the automated Pareto Analysis systems we have developed for many different processes.

The goal was to answer the common questions we receive about MES systems. What is an MES system? What is OEE? How do I use OEE to impact my costs/profits? What are other common Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)? How does my team access the information the MES system provides? System Selection One question asked in both sessions was: \"How do you help someone decide what MES platform is right for them?\" The answer is almost as open ended as the number of choices on the market. Here is our process to help a customer choose an MES solution: 1. Does the customer have a preference for one system over another? This can be based on seeing a system in place at another facility, marketing materials, or just personal preference. In some cases this can make for a quick decision process. 2. Is there a software platform already in place on the control system side? For example, they are already using Inductive Automation, Rockwell Automation, Siemens, Wonderware, etc. If so it usually makes sense to stick with the vendor they already have. There are already software support costs, internal knowledge, and a foundation for integration between the two systems. The caveat here is if they are not happy with the existing system for some reason. In this case we would keep digging deeper. 3. Are there any hardware compatibility issues with a particular MES system and the PLCs on the plant floor? In most cases communicating between any MES system and any PLC isn't impossible. Certain combinations of software and hardware may prove to be more costly. For example, if there is an older PLC requiring serial communications, an MES system with this option built into the software is a good option. Contrast this with a system that without serial support, requiring a hardware interface at the PLC level. The other cost for communication hurdles is an OPC server to link software to hardware. In single vendor systems this is usually not required, but can be the easiest way to bridge the vendor gaps in some facilities. 4. The final question geared towards existing infrastructure is what business systems and ERP system is in use on the business side? Most MES systems can communicate with most databases and ERP systems, with the potential for extra integration time in some cases. These questions help define the costs to integrate a particular MES system into existing systems. Assuming at this point the options haven't been narrowed down enough we get into more specific questions. 5. How much ownership of the system does the customer want to have long-term? If the customer wants to maintain and grow the system internally, their level of technical competence can dictate the right option. MES systems move beyond ladder logic and HMI development into the world of databases, web services, and IT infrastructure. If the customer does not have internal resources to maintain these systems, the choice for a more user friendly system is easy. If instead the customer is comfortable using the system integrator for ongoing support, this isn't as big of a factor. 6. Does the customer want a single system with a wide array functionality, or many smaller systems with more specialized functionality? For example, it is possible to buy a system with OEE, SPC, Track and Trace, Reporting, ERP integrations, and other KPIs and tools built into one interface. Or they can start with OEE and Reporting tools, then buy a separate system with SPC, one for Track and Trace, and integrate everything as the system grows. This choice is usally dictacted by who \"owns\" the system. A single system is usually better for the process operations team to manage, while the multiple system approach can be better for IT to manage. Smaller systems \"touch\" less of the process at a time, requiring less domain knowledge about any one area. All-encompassing systems interact with more of the process and other pieces of the system, making it easier for someone familiar with the process to manage. At this point, we have usually narrowed the options down to 2 to 3 systems. This brings us to the final question: 7. Overall Cost. The cost of the system is a huge factor in deciding which option to select. This includes the cost of the software, networking hardware, and servers required to run the system. It also includes the labor and time to integrate the system with the shop floor and the top floor. This is where the system archictecture can influence the lifecycle of the project. Smaller systems can be implemented in phases, spreading the costs of both software/hardware and labor out over time. Larger systems integrations can be phased, with a higher software cost up front. Implementations cost is where the discussion of ROI comes into play with the cost/benefit analysis also influencing the decision. Organizational Interfaces Another question we got was about difficulty between production staff and IT on MES projects. \"How do we overcome the organizational hurdles between production and IT to integrate business and production systems?\" This is a common problem. Production needs to have certain network access to enable database connections. IT wants to keep everything secure and not open ports. Some software installations need administrator rights and users don't have them. IT doesn't know the ins and outs of manufacturing software and can't foresee potential pitfalls. We overcome these issues by acting as the middleman or facilitator for discussions between production and the rest of the organization. We have experience on both sides of the table and understand how to frame information and requests so the other side can hear them. IT is not against making it easy for production systems to access business systems. They are against opening up the network to unnecessary security risk. They will give permissions to set up software when necessary, and will reduce them upon completion to ensure system integrity. Framing the discussion in specific terms is the first step to get IT to buy into an MES project. The main questions you will need to answer are: What access is necessary, physical, network, and user permissions? What data is required? What is what is the least risky way to access the data? Putting together this information before sitting down with IT will ease frustration across the board. Other things we like to do are to bring IT in once you have decided to move forward with an MES project. Keep them in the loop as you make vendor decisions. Introduce your integration partners to IT and start the relationship as early as possible. The other hurdle to overcome is understanding system ownership. If IT will manage licensing, support, and configuration after the project is complete, involve them in the project. Include them in training sessions, and help them learn the production side of the MES system. The same holds true on the production side if production will take ownership. Continuous Improvement The final question we would like to cover focused on the long-term use of MES in an organization. \"How do you ensure a company participates in continuous improvement over the life of an MES system?\" The foundation of continuous improvement is cultural within an organization. It requires business objectives to be tied to continuous improvement. It also requires internal champions to monitor, maintain, and even retire KPIs, reports, and other informational tools over time. For example, a company is tracking OEE, and finds their main downtime issue is changeovers on a particular machine. Seeking to narrow down the cause, the add a KPI for changeover durations on this machine. After measuring for a couple of weeks they find the problem stems from a lack of training. After revamping the training class and re-training the operators, the issue is largely resolved. In some companies, once this measurement has made it into reports, it will be in the reports forever. The thinking here is something was important enough to measure once should be measured forever. This type of thinking will eventually lead to information overload. The goal of continuous improvement is to always improve your results. As your results improve, you will also need to improve your tools and processes to stay up to date with the rest of your process. This means it is important to use measurements for only as long as they are useful. Once issues are fixed and the measurements are no longer changing, they can be taken out of regular circulation. Many times we have gone into a facility and they have dozens of pages of reports, and everyone only looks at one or two pages. These pages focus on the current initiatives and the rest have just never been taken out of the reports. Continuous improvement is all about changing the idea of \"that's how we have always done things.\" We hope you enjoyed our webinar and were able to learn something.
