Let’s say you run a small brewery. You take your raw ingredients, run them through the mashing and boiling processes, let the liquid ferment and finally put it into bottles or cans to be shipped to your customers. Odds are your goal is to product a consistent product. Along with your recipe you likely have a clipboard to track data for each batch. The amount of raw ingredients, what variety of hops, how long you boiled everything, fermentation duration, alcohol content, etc. Once you have run a complete batch through quality control you might generate some more data on color, taste, clarity, and so on. The recipe and all of the data you collect during the brewing process can easily be entered into a system making this data more valuable than a sheet of paper in a filing cabinet. Instead of a drawer as the final home for your data, imagine you open a web-browser, log in to a site and input the data into a database. For each step of the brewing process you can pull up a report comparing this batch to any or all of your previous batches and get a detailed view of how it compares. You can even have a good idea of what your final product will look like based on all of your experience with the data to back up your gut. The real value of the system comes when you make subsequent batches and generate more data. If you make a particularly great tasting batch, can you easily identify what was different about the process compared to a normal batch? Were there any differences in your ingredients? Would you like to be able to repeat your results and have the ability to spot trends in your final products? When a major distributor picks up your product and you need to increase production how easily can you ramp up production to meet demand? These questions are all things a large brewer like Anheuser-Busch has answered. They track a lot of data for every batch. If something ends up tasting off in the end product they can compare the batch to every other batch in their database and diagnose likely causes. They track the effect of various ingredients on the final product, finding ways to brew consistent tasting products at any of their facilities. Granted their brewing process is heavily automated which simplifies data collection, the concepts of using a centralized data collection system to brew smarter can be implemented in any size brewery. We have have had the opportunity to implement similar systems that make the lives of operators and artisans easier. Once people get their hands on this type of technology they get excited about what they can do next. Turning data into information makes it easy to increase productivity, consistency, and customer satisfaction. Intelligent information about a process truly expands the horizon of what is possible and gives people the tools to operate at their highest potential.

Learn how project management software can keep your team in the loop and your project on track. Anyone who has been given the responsibility of managing a project knows the obstacles that come with keeping on schedule, staying under budget, and facilitating teams of people. Being no stranger to that ourselves, we have created tools for other companies as well as for our own internal use, that make the task of effectively managing a project realistic. On any project there are a lot of moving pieces whether you're building a deck or managing an expansion to a new facility. Often times dates get moved around, material prices change, sub-contractors don't show, and before you know it the schedule and budget are as good as gone. Let's take the example of a construction company. A project manager has a variety of responsibilities, including, but not limited to: managing employees day to day tasks, coordinating sub-contractors' visits to the site for evaluation and implementation, managing customer relationships, checking email and messages to stay up to date with the main office. This amount of information can be overwhelming for one person to keep track of and often gets lost in translation. When the scope of work or the hour of a meeting changes, material delivery is late, or the customer updates a request, not everyone on the team will be automatically updated, if at all. This makes it difficult to track what's getting done. That leads to the main office getting bits and pieces of information and a team in the field trying to finish a project on a faulty foundation. Through our experience working with projects of various size we've seen anything and everything that can go wrong with a project. That's what led us to working on project management software that solves the headaches of staying on schedule, under budget, and in communication with your team. Project Management software is a framework for your every day processes that can be used as frequently or as little as necessary. Depending on how much communication you want, every major or minor change that happens can be pushed to anyone who needs to know automatically. We have seen countless situations where teams work better and communicate more efficiently by letting software do the heavy lifting for them. Take the construction company as an example. With a project management system in place, the foreman can handle changes in the field and update everyone on the project as things occur. The system can alert people in the way that best suits them, whether it be text message, email, or otherwise. Project management software is found in every industry and can be applied to any project. Each industry uses these systems in their own unique way because of how flexible software can be. A good way to implement a project management system at your company is to use it on a small project to get your feet wet. Chances are you and your team will find things you love and other things that need to be tailored to your specific needs. If you decide these systems are beneficial to your team and process, it's important to find a tool that can grow with your company.

Production scheduling, process data from the plant floor, shipping and receiving management, staff scheduling, etc. Most of the time these systems are implemented at different points of a company's lifecycle and are not designed with the other systems in mind. With today's technology making it easy to integrate systems into a cohesive tool, see how you can get more value from your existing infrastructure. A Mile in Your Shoes When we go to a facility for the first time we put ourselves in your shoes as we seek to understand your culture, people, and processes. We tend to find a few common, interesting things: Work orders are usually on a sheet of paper physically located at operator workstations Inefficient communication throughout the entire process - from customer orders to the production floor all the way through order fulfillment Machine maintenance being done too often or not often enough, causing too much planned or unplanned downtime Delays in the process not being communicated back to production scheduling causing an increase in lead times Quality control staff asking production staff for process data information costing time on both sides of the equation Many of these issues cause delays in order fulfillment and ultimately increase workload and stress on your staff. This not only can lead to mandatory overtime to meet production demand while still maintaining the delivery schedule, but also to not meeting customer expectations and possibly hurting relationships. Enter the concept of the digital factory. By utilizing fully-integrated systems and mobile technology, production efficiency and employee effectiveness can operate at their highest potential. Let's take a look at a few ideas of how intelligent systems can streamline your operation: Communication Across the Organization Notification: Communication can happen automatically, alerting staff on a periodic or real-time basis about changes in production, maintenance issues, process metrics and KPIs Documentation: Information on how to handle process upsets, workflow manuals or any other required documentation can be built directly into your systems no longer requiring operators to leave their station to ask a question Information: Process data can be made available from the shop to the top floor including QA/QC, shipping, sales, and management keeping everyone up-to-date at a level of granularity specific to their needs Organization: If you have more than one facility everyone in your entire company can keep up to date with all of your production facilities. You can also limit access to any portion of the system to specific employees, giving everyone access to the information they need to see, when they need to see it Training and Best Practices Tutorials: Training materials can be easily accessible when they are immediately useful making it easy for operators to accomplish periodic tasks in a timely manner and make it easy to cross train other employees on any job function Internal Wiki: Best practices, detailed instructions and institutional knowledge can all be recorded making it easy to keep everyone up to speed on how things should be done at your company Worker Productivity Maintenance: Your work order system can be directly integrated into plant floor data to automatically generate work orders as they are needed per manufacturer's specifications reducing under or over-maintaining equipment. Maintenance personnel can update and manage work orders with automatic notification to operators and other personnel as maintenance work is completed Operations: Your operations staff can quickly see when process upsets will affect their workflow, as well as generate and monitor maintenance work-orders directly from their stations Metrics: In-app dashboards can show metrics for your facility keeping them front-of-mind for your staff. These metrics can include the KPIs you already use to track the health of your operation with the added benefit of brining up historical data to compare to previous production shifts at any time These are just a handful of the potentially unlimited number of ideas on how you can utilize a fully integrated, intelligent system at your organization. When you empower your people to do their job more effectively you will see improvement in the KPIs and metrics you use to monitor the health of your operation. This can result in happier customers, employees and improve your bottom line by better utilizing the data you already have available.

Keeping everyone up to date on every aspect of operations can take a lot of time and lead to lots of confusion. Find out what many companies have found to be a better way to track performance. Keeping It Simple Do you ever procrastinate when you need to put together a report on how your company is doing on any given day? You may have to dig through a handful of reports, run some calculations in Excel and go interrupt some other people to get information on their department. What if all of this work could be boiled down into an automatically generated report emailed out to everyone who needs the information? What if the report gave anyone who wanted to dig deeper the ability to get the information at the level of detail they want, on-demand? This type of system is one of the benefits of the idea of the digital factory. As each department completes its tasks relevant information is entered into the intelligence database. You and your staff determine the important metrics to measure and calculations you use to distill those metrics into a handful of numbers known as Key Performance Indicators or KPIs. The Rubber Meets The Road What is a KPI? A KPI is a way to simply convey complex information. One example in the manufacturing world is known as Overall Equipment Effectiveness or OEE. This is a calculation involving the uptime of a process, the quality of produced goods, and how quickly those goods were produced. These values are compared to their ideal amounts giving you a percentage value of the health of your operation. Once you have this value you can determine if it meets your needs or if it needs to be improved. If it needs to be improved you drill down into the three component values and start asking questions. Is one of the metrics causing the number to drop quite a bit? Which one? If your line is accruing lots of unplanned downtime dig deeper and see how to fix it. If you are getting a larger than usual number of bad parts, why? This functionality can be built directly into your system, automatically generating OEE per day, shift, etc. The values in the report can be directly linked to raw data allowing you to ask and answer any questions you may have about the data in the report. Looking Forward We will dig deeper into how you can implement KPIs at your company in the next few posts. For now here is a list of a few common KPIs we have helped out customers design systems around: OEE - based on runtime, quality, process speed Average Production Per Shift - comparing shifts can lead to friendly competition Downtime - reducing downtime increases productivity Changeover Time - reducing changeover time increases process runtime Equipment/Process Alarms - tracking the number of alarms for various pieces of equipment can be an indicator of potential maintenance needs Reject Count - tracking reject counts per line or piece of equipment can give you indications of potential workflow or process changes you may want to implement We are always looking for ways to help our customers and others in any industry.

Learn how you can start small and avoid common pitfalls companies run into when rolling out a comprehensive system all at once. One mistake organizations make when rolling out performance monitoring is to try and capture all of the data at one time. Instead of building a cultural foundation it is taken on as a project with a lot riding on its success. This is an easy approach to start out with based on the marketing material and training for performance monitoring methodologies. After consuming a handful of brochures, books and webinars it might seem that performance monitoring is a silver bullet to solve all of your companies needs. While it is a great tool, performance monitoring is just that and by not learning how to use it properly on the small scale it can fail to live up to its expectations at scale. If you were new to construction would you get more return in the long run by building a mansion as your first project or building up to that after starting with a playhouse? Starting small with a pilot test of performance monitoring at your company has some distinct advantages: 1. Wax on, Wax off Just like most other things you have learned in life reading about it doesn't alone make you a master. Instead you learn more by starting with a small goal, figuring out how to achieve it and growing from there. 2. ...And that's the bottom line By starting small you can prove the capability of performance monitor to provide an ROI. You can also learn how to build the tools into the culture and avoid wasting valuable resources by over-developing your tools up-front. 3. Engagement should come naturally With a comprehensive approach to performance monitoring you will inevitably get pushback from some people who feel like they are being forced into a new paradigm. By starting small you can work with the people most likely to embrace the change and allow them to become your internal champions. Getting buy-in prior to rolling out performance monitoring is a much better way to ensure its success. Looking Ahead The next question you might have is where you should look to start with your performance monitoring efforts. Depending on your company you may have a lot of options, we will look at some common ones and some case studies in future posts. We are always looking for ways to help our customers and others in any industry. If you would like to hear our opinions about anything in particular please feel free to reach out to us and let us know what you want us to include in future posts.

By learning and documenting your processes you can easily identify key results to use in your performance monitoring efforts. What is one of the first things Warren Buffett, one of the world's most successful investors, does when he buys a company? If most of his purchases are anything like some companies he recently purchased at which we know a lot of people, it is to understand and document their existing processes. The goal behind this is two-fold. First it is to understand what the company has done to make it successful enough for him to want to purchase in the first place. The second is to see where the company's processes need to be streamlined or replaced with his own processes. There is another benefit to this method as opposed to going into a company and revamping their entire workflow from the beginning. It makes it easier to get everyone's buy-in on the restructuring. Defense For people who are passionate about what they do, restructuring can be hard to swallow. They may have some personal investment in the processes themselves, having developed or influenced them along the way. Ripping out those processes and putting in new ones can immediately put someone in their position on the defensive. This isn't a bad thing or a character flaw, it is a normal reaction to hearing your way of doing things might not be the best way out there. Instead if the processes are documented and understood they can be assessed on a level playing field with a different way of doing things. This can lead to fruitful discussions with the stakeholder in the original process feeling like they are being heard and can dramatically increase their level of buy-in. First and 10 Once discussions about the old and the new methodologies have taken place incremental changes can be made. This is not unlike American football in that the goal every play isn't to score a touchdown, it is to move the ball 10 yards down the field to maintain possession on the path to scoring a touchdown. This approach breaks down the final result into small, easily digestible, and complete-able chunks. It also makes it easy to track progress and understand what is working and what needs to be adjusted along the way. Two-Point Conversion In addition to obtaining buy-in, the other benefit to the incremental approach to change is the ability for there to be learning in both directions. Every so often there will be an idea Warren Buffett might adopt from one of his subsidiaries that can change how his other companies are run. To keep to the football analogy this is like the introduction of the two-point conversion to make the game a little more interesting to watch. This isn't necessarily going to be a complete overhaul of the system, just a subtle tweak to make it better overall. Post-Game Wrap-up The first step in implementing a performance monitoring strategy isn't to dive in and build a system with a dashboard and some metrics. The first step is to understand how your business operates and the processes used to run it day to day. Once you know those you can easily identify what you can and should measure to begin improving things. Someday you might make it to the Superbowl but first you need to be able to make it 10 yards down the field. We are always looking for ways to help our customers and others in any industry.

Big Data At work Just when you thought big data couldn’t get any bigger, Twitter and IBM recently announced a new partnership. Here’s the breakdown of the deal and what it means for consumers, developers, and businesses. IBM's super computers like WATSON (which have been known to beat most humans in chess and Jeopardy) will gain access to all twitter data. On the surface you might wonder what exactly IBM is looking to do with all of that data, but Chris Moody, IBM's CEO breaks it down for us. \"This partnership, drawing on IBM's leading cloud-based analytics platform, will help clients enrich business decisions with an entirely new class of data. This is the latest example of how IBM is re-imaging work\" -Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President and CEO, IBM. This is a big deal on both ends of the deal. Twitter houses invaluable data such as how people feel about businesses and who they care about interacting with, while IBM holds the tools that can take that data and turn it into relevant information. Turning data into real world information is arguably more important than having the data itself, and this partnership is going to give businesses a better look at their customers. What It Means to Consumers Like it or not, everything you post on Twitter, or any form social media, is going to be used to better understand you. A common saying is \"if you are not paying for it, you are the product.\" This phrase is debatable on a case by case basis, but don't fret if you are worried about your personal information. IBM's tools are designed to gain a better understanding of trends in the market and are not focused on the specifics of individual user data.

One way of doing this is by using Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk Metrics package. In this series we will cover the basics of what Metrics does and its benefits, details on implementation , and how to quickly realize the ROI on your investment. Turning Data into Information Many manufacturing companies cannot easily assess the health of their plants. This is rarely due to a lack of data. Process Historians collect real-time data and can be used to show trends over time, quality control data can be compared to those trends and even some KPIs can be calculated for the process as a whole. This system breaks down when raw data is the only resource available to provide the necessary insight to answer questions about operations. Data fails to take into account micro-level details affecting macro-level performance. For example, with raw data alone it can be difficult to determine which machines are causing the most downtime, where bottlenecks are in the process and where quality losses are greatest. Determining the top 10 causes of downtime would require first collecting all of the data in one location, summing the downtime for all pieces of equipment, and ordering the list. If you are lucky you might be able to get all of this done before the phone rings with some other distractions. How do people find ways to track their process, find the major issues, and get them resolved? One way is to use performance management systems such as FactoryTalk Metrics. These type of systems take the process data you are already collecting and provide the context necessary for the data to be useful as a decision making tool. Deciding to Do Things Differently The decision to implement a performance monitoring system can seem daunting. The cost of buying the software, the time involved in configuring things, learning a new system and integrating it into your workflow. While there are some costs associated with the system both in terms of time and resources, these systems can have a direct impact on your bottom line. One simple is example of this is by using the tools to identify and reduce the top 3 reasons for downtime in your plant, thus automatically increasing productivity. Our customers have made similar gains by decreasing processing time by identifying bottlenecks and reducing re-work and scrap by identifying faulty equipment. In this series we will focus on FactoryTalk Metrics. We will answer some common questions about what FactoryTalk Metrics is, what it isn't, and discuss of the direct benefits our customers have found after using the tools. If you are looking at similar solutions from other companies, we will cover those after we discuss FactoryTalk Metrics. We have worked with similar tools from most of the major companies and will do a compare and contrast post after we have gone into some detail across the board. To summarize, performance management systems give you the ability to ask questions about your operation whille at the same time giving you the information you need to answer those questions and prioritize improvements. The give you an honest assessment of your plant's health. While this may be difficult to stomach, if your plant needs some help wouldn't you want to know exactly what to fix to make it better?

A way to get data into the system, a way to analyze that data and a way to view the results. FactoryTalk Metrics operates the same way. Data from your process control system is brought into Metrics using FactoryTalk Transaction Manager, stored in a SQL Server database and accessed in reports using Report Expert or along with real-time process data visualization using FactoryTalk VantagePoint. In this post we will give you an overview of how FactoryTalk Metrics models your process and data is brought into the system. The next post will discuss how to access the data using Report Expert and FactoryTalk VantagePoint in addition to integrating with other business systems you may be using. Modeling Your Process FactoryTalk Metrics allows you to logically model your entire process. This is done is by defining areas known as \"work cells\". In a typical configuration a work cell would be mapped to a specific area of the process, for example, packaging or raw material feed. For each work cell you can track OEE and its components, downtime, throughput, and production cycle times in addition to various events from your process. Work cells are comprised of various pieces of equipment. In a packaging work cell at a food and beverage facility you may have a former, a filler, a sealer, and a metal detector. You can track downtime, throughput, cycle time, and events for each piece of equipment in your work cell. FactoryTalk Metrics also allows you to enter your production schedules, shifts and planned downtime. Utilizing your actual production schedules allows you to analyze data by shift, crew, and by date giving you the ability to further understand how your entire plant, including personnel, is doing. By utilizing work cells and production scheduling to model your facility you can use FactoryTalk Metrics to get a detailed view of every piece of equipment in your entire facility during all of your scheduled production runs. You also have the ability to monitor how each piece of equipment contributes to your process losses. This removes operator error in tracking process upsets and gives you a true view of the health of your plant. Tracking Your Process Work cells and equipment utilize events to trigger downtime start/end times, track throughput and changes in cycle times. This allows you to configure complex conditions for tracking downtime including when upstream or downstream issues cause production losses at any point in the process. Each event can utilize manually entered information, including reason codes. The true power of events comes into play when you implement automatic reason code tracking. This feature allows you to easily determine when your process went down, what piece(s) of equipment took it down, and the exact reason for the problem. This allows you to understand, on great detail, the cause of your most common production losses, allowing you to quickly and clearly prioritize maintenance and process changes to affect your bottom line. All of the data tracked by FactoryTalk Metrics is accessible using the included analysis tools and can be integrated into other business systems directly through the database. This gives you the ability to truly turn your process data into useful information from the shop floor to the top floor. Communicating With Your Process The central nervous system of FactoryTalk Metrics is FactoryTalk Transaction Manager. The data from your PLCs can be stored directly into a SQL Server database using FactoryTalk Transaction Manager. This allows you to populate the FactoryTalk Metrics database, and also to get real-time process data directly into any of your other SQL Server based systems without having to go through a Process Historian. Granted you don't want to store all of your process data this way, still it is extremely useful to save some manual data entry into you ERP system for example. A Full-Service Performance Management Solution Implementing FactoryTalk Metrics gives you accurate, real-time tracking of your processes' performance and the tools you need to analyze and improve operations. In addition to tracking OEE and its components, downtime, throughput, and cycle time, you can incorporate data from your PLCs directly into any of your other SQL Server based systems using FactoryTalk Transaction Manager. FactoryTalk Metrics is an easy to configure and use tool capable of giving you the ability to understand and manage your process at an extremely detailed level.

Report Expert provides a quick and simple way to access the most common data used to assess plant performance with pre-configured reports capable of tracking your entire process or filtering down to any level of detail to answer your most important questions. Reports One of the main benefits of FactoryTalk Metrics is how quickly you can view actionable data from the system. Using the Report Expert package, in a matter of minutes you can have access to 69 pre-configured reports filterable by just about any metric you can imagine. These reports allow you to drill down to the finest level of detail on any piece of equipment to understand the exact causes for production losses at any point in time. In addition to the out-of-the-box reports you have full access to modify the existing reports or create your own from scratch. Custom reports can also be used to display information from other systems you may be using, giving you even greater access to information across your entire organization. These reports can also easily be auto-generated and sent out to key-personnel in your organization. No longer will you need to spend hours going through process logs, tracking incomplete records on downtime, and trying to understand notes from an operator on hour 7 of a graveyard shift to put together an Excel spreadsheet to calculate overall losses. You can instead show up at the beginning of your shift with a clear view of exactly what your process did the previous day. Sorting all of your events by reason codes will give you the insight into what needs to be fixed and the exact impact those efforts will have on production. With this information in hand you can easily go from putting out fires to focus on continuous improvement. Trending In addition to reports you can display all of the data from your FactoryTalk Metrics system in FactoryTalk VantagePoint with less time to configure than it takes to make your morning coffee. If you have a process historian you can put process and Metrics data on one trend allowing you to understand exactly what your process was doing prior to any events. The power in this scenario lies in the ability to begin to notice issues long before they happen. One real-world example from one of our customers is at a powder processing facility. They noticed the pumps used to move powder from drying to processing were shutting down on a regular basis causing large amounts of downtime. The issue was as the powder was pushed through the pipes sometimes it would start to clog and if left unchecked for the rest of the shift would cause blockages and the pumps to trip on over-current. After understanding the cause of the issue and tracking when the equipment went down alongside real-time data, the engineer noticed that between 2 and 3 hours prior to the fan tripping off the amperage had a slight spike with a correlating pressure drop at the pipe exit shortly thereafter. This information was implemented as an event with automatic notification for maintenance to clear the blockage at the next break. This nearly eliminated this issue as a cause for downtime immediately increasing the plant's average production. Business System Integration If you have any systems elsewhere in your business you can easily integrate FactoryTalk Metrics information into their workflows. Maybe process downtime directly affects product quality testing schedules. You can notify your quality technicians of process upsets on particular product runs allowing them to schedule their time more effectively. Another example might be when product quality directly affects when shipments will go out and the shipping department can be immediately notified of delays so they can manage customer expectations as soon as necessary to maintain customer agreements. Integrating with your business systems is likely more complicated than implementing FactoryTalk Metrics in the first place, however you can work with your IT staff or outside developers to access this data directly from the database. We have leveraged this capability for many of our customers with great success. All of the data is available for you to use and there is excellent documentation on how everything is laid out making it easy to access the information to provide value to your entire organization. T-Minus Time to Success Implementing the reporting and analysis tools for FactoryTalk Metrics is a very quick process. Using the pre-built reports in Report Expert gives you access to the most common pieces of information used to impact your bottom line. If something is not immediately available in the stock reports you can easily build your own custom reports. Possibly the most important question you can answer is why wouldn't you want to have access to all of the information about your process? If you could increase capacity, reduce costs, and enable continuous improvement using the equipment you already have along with better information would that better your bottom line?

Where would you even begin to calculate this value if someone asked for it? We are going to show you how you can incorporate all of the costs associated with producing products into an overall cost-per-unit. This value can be calculated in real-time, giving you a concrete demonstration of how your day-to-day actions directly affect your bottom line. Energy One potentially variable cost to manufacturing is energy. This mainly includes electricity and gas, and could also include the cost of heating your plant, leaving the lights on, etc. If you are IKEA you can save the cost of the lights by using robots to do all of the work. Depending on your facility you may be able to install power meters that track the global energy usage of your plant, or you might be able to install equipment level monitoring. Either way or a combination of both will give you better information about the cost-per-unit. From these meters you can read data directly into your process historian. If your plant is in a place where the temperature doesn't fluctuate much during the year you might find your climate control costs to be pretty constant. If this is the case, this along with other fixed costs, you have the option of building these directly into your calculation of cost-per-unit. If instead you live in an area where the temperature fluctuates throughout the year you will likely find as it gets warmer or cooler your cost-per-unit increases due to additional climate control requirements. If you are like some of our customers you may have set up power purchasing agreements directly with utilities or through an energy aggregator. Depending on your agreement you might be charged more for peak usage, which adds further cost variability. Your cost-per-unit at peak usage times would be higher than non-peak. Labor Another major contribution to your cost per unit is labor. On a basic level this can simply be the sum of the total cost of each operator on the line per hour x the number of hours per shift. Depending on the makeup of your production crews this cost can vary. One way to reduce variability would be to structure your crews with identical skill levels on each shift. Another labor cost that might be involved is maintenance. Depending on your budget this may or may not be in the same bucket as operations, still maintenance is part of the cost-per-unit, even if indirectly. If maintenance workers are required to resolve a downtime issue the cost-per-unit fluctuates based on how much lost production you face. Regardless of how you decide to calculate the labor component of cost-per-unit this data is likely available in an ERP system or can be made available in a database accessible to your enterprise intelligence system. Shipping, Inventory, Other Misc. Costs Other costs you should include are shipping, inventory, and any other miscellaneous costs incurred in getting your raw materials to the plant, processed, and shipped to the customer. Depending on your organization this information may be available in your ERP system or may need to be entered manually. Either way it can be helpful to include these costs, especially if they are variable, to get a complete picture of your cost-per-unit. Bringing It All Together Once you have identified all of the components of your cost-per-unit you need a way to calculate the value. Luckily you can use data from your ERP system, process historian, and any manually entered data, run a query in a database and get the result. From there you can send this value over to a dashboard used by management to track costs, put it in a report that goes to the finance department to understand pricing, how SKUs are performing based on their costs, and if there are areas where resources can be saved. You can even send the number to your control room for display on your HMI so the operators know where they stand at any given time. In Summary Cost-per-unit incorporates a lot of data while giving you a valuable piece of information. It is affected by your staff, your energy consumption, and many other factors. Using cost-per-unit you can easily see the impact of downtime on profitability, which shifts are more profitable, and what times of year are more profitable. You can use this information to optimize any number of processes to maximize your profitability by reducing your cost-per-unit.
