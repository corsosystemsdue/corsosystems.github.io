<h3>You get asked a lot of <b style="color:#f64100;">questions</b></h3>

<p style="text-align:left;">Easy questions like what you do for a living... where you are from... where you went to school...</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Fun questions like who is your favorite sports team &mdash; what's the best restaurant in town &mdash; or what music you would have on a desert island.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Tough questions like how are you going to meet your production quotas with less budget, staff, and without new equipment?</p>

<br/>
<h3>Do you enjoy <b style="color:#f64100;">asking</b> questions... Even <b style="color:#f64100;">difficult</b> ones?</h3>

<ul style="text-align:left;">
	<li>How do you interface a certain PLC with a certain piece of software?</li>
	<li>Is the price you are being charged for this work fair?</li>
	<li>Can you find an easy way to tell when your bottles are full? Everything so far hasn't worked.</li>
	<li>Maybe your business has nothing to do with manufacturing, what can you do to improve your operation?</li>
	<li>What is MES, PLM, SCADA, PMP, PE, ERP, and SIL, and why should you care?</li>
	<li>How do you find the right people for your team?</li>
	<li>Can this super complicated work flow be simplified so you don't have to spend 90% of your day troubleshooting confusion?</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<div style="text-align:center;width:100%;">
	<h4>Why ask questions?</h4>
	

	<h4 style="text-align:center;">One way people learn is by understanding things &mdash; through questions.</h4>

<h3><b style="color:#f64100;">More Information</b> lets you make <b style="color:#f64100;">Better Decisions</b></h3>


<p style="text-align:left;">Arming yourself with <b>more information</b> gives you <b>more options</b>. You can see <b>new possibilities</b> and find new ways to get where <b>you want to be</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Sometimes you just need some moral support. We have been there... Knowing someone else has been down the same road is sometimes all you need to push into new territory.</p>

<h3>What do <b style="color:#f64100;">you</b> want to learn?</h3>

<p style="text-align:left;">If you had a group of <b>experts</b> at your disposal, available to answer any question you might have, would you step up to the plate and ask?</p>


<p>It doesn't even have to be manufacturing related.</p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Want some help navigating social media?</li>
<li>What podcasts we listen to when we are driving to a job-site?</li>
<li>What beer we had in some far-away land and are craving to this day?</li> 
<li>What about the best places to eat wherever we have done a project?</li>
</ul>
